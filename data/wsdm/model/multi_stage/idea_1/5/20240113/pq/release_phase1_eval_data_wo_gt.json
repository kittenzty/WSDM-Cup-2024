The interface between the wire and the heating wire must absolutely not touch the water. Secondly, you must watch when you are burning, because it actually boils water very quickly, it takes about ten minutes for me to fill a bucket. The most important point is that you must not touch the water directly when boiling water, you absolutely can't. To feel the temperature, you can dry your hands and lightly touch some parts of the outer perimeter of the container (as far away from 'Rèdékuài' as possible).

Liars will deliberately correct their actions, for example, when they are surprised, they will maintain a surprised expression, rather than return to normal in a second. Liars will deliberately make their description of what happened very smooth, and even embellish it, but often the real things need time to recall, to accurately express. When judging whether a person is lying, observing their body language and eyes is a common technique. For example, frequent hand movements touching the face, lips or nose; clenching fists, grabbing objects or their own body; crossing fingers, rubbing palms and other nervous hand movements; stiff body, shrinking, avoiding eye contact; small body shaking or leg shaking unnatural movements; avoidance of gaze: frequently avoiding direct eye contact or changing the focus; pupil changes: pupils dilate or shrink, although this may be due to changes in light or emotion; blinking frequency: increase or decrease in blinking frequency, especially in situations inconsistent with usual. These observation indicators are called non-verbal clues in criminal investigation methods and can be part of the clues, but these indicators alone cannot determine whether a person is lying. In criminal investigation methods, these observation indicators are usually combined with other evidence and technical means, such as facial expression analysis, voice analysis, behavior analysis, etc., to comprehensively judge whether a person is lying.\nSo how can you tell if someone is lying?\n"

Then, measure the hole size and write it on the wall with a marker. Next, copy all measurement data to the form and take photos of all holes on both sides. Finally, add names to all photos. For the measurement of the door hole, you need to actually measure the width and height of the door hole, and see if the upper, middle, and lower parts of the door hole are consistent. If they are not consistent, take the narrowest part as the standard, but the error should not exceed 20mm. Also, measure the thickness of the door hole wall at the upper, middle, and lower parts to see if the thickness of the wall is the same. At the same time, see if the thickness of the left and right walls and the thickness of the top wall of the door hole are the same. If they are not the same, take their maximum value, but the error should not exceed 5mm. If the wall thickness error exceeds 5mm, it needs to be corrected. If the wall is a T-wall, a false wall with a width of 50-60mm needs to be made with plywood to place the door casing. The thickness is the same as the wall thickness. The thickness of the door hole wall should not be less than 80mm. The strength of the door frame with a size lower than 80mm is not very high, and the support for the door is not enough. If it is less than 80mm, the thickness of the wall needs to be increased to more than 80mm. When there is a protruding beam on the door hole, the upper door casing cannot be installed. A false wall with a height of 50-60mm also needs to be made with plywood, which is the same length as the width of the door hole and the same depth as the thickness of the door hole. If there are steps in the door hole, the face casing on the side with steps should add the height of the steps, and the specific size depends on the height of the steps. The thickness of the toilet and kitchen door hole wall must pay special attention to the thickness of the wall tiles on the wall. Generally, single-sided tiles are 25mm thick, and double-sided tiles are 50mm thick. The specific situation is confirmed by the designer, customer, and renovation company. The final size should include the thickness of the wall tiles. It is best to measure after the wall tiles are pasted. Pay attention to the opening direction of the door when measuring.

Most places where German roaches are noisy at home are typically dirty and messy indoor environments, lots of things, and they don't pay attention to hygiene.

So if you want to eradicate cockroaches, you must throw away the things that should be thrown away at home, especially the things that have not been used for two years. Don't hesitate to throw away and turn your home into a place where cockroaches like to hide. The third step is to use the right tools and methods to kill cockroaches. For example, pyrethroid insecticides can adhere to the sprayed objects to form a drug film on the objects and stay for a while. This pyrethroid effective component film has an avoidance effect on cockroaches. Then, the probability of cockroaches going to eat gel bait on the drug film will be greatly reduced. In addition, fipronil is a third-generation nicotinic insecticide that is very friendly and low-toxic to mammals. Its ld50 toxicity is lower than that of salt. After being dissolved in water, it can be sprayed on sofas, carpets, floor mats, etc., and a touch-kill drug film with a lasting effect for several weeks can be formed after drying.\nSo how can cockroaches be eradicated completely?\n"

If you do not stretch properly after tiring exercise, your muscles will remain tense, which can easily lead to muscle fatigue, stiffness, and even possible sports injuries. In addition, stretching after exercise is different from before, it requires static stretching to relax the tense muscles. You need to relax when your body temperature is hot, don't wait for people to sweat and cool down before stretching. Stretching when the body temperature is hot will stretch more open. If you like to rest for a long time after exercise or if your stretching often does not reach the point, you can use Puressentiel to help stretch and relax muscles and joints.\nWhat did you find?\n"

Third, ensure a balanced diet every day, eat a moderate amount of vitamin-rich foods, such as tomatoes, carrots, lemons, etc., and insist on drinking enough water, which is beneficial to physical health and also helps to enhance the baby's resistance. Fourth, avoid smoke, second-hand smoke and air pollutants, these harmful substances will stimulate the baby's respiratory tract, causing the baby to cough frequently.

Aging tea trees mainly use heavy pruning and terracing measures, combined with shaping pruning and top-light picking to rejuvenate the tea tree crown. In terms of picking, there are standard picking, timely picking, batch multiple picking, and leaf retention picking. Hand picking includes pinching (breaking), straight picking, double-hand picking, and machine picking. The trimming time is generally in mid-to-late April for Longjing 43 tea garden. The spring tea can be pruned immediately after picking. At this time, it is generally heavy repair. The lower the cut, the stronger the bud will be next year. But if the cut is too low, the yield will be low next year. Therefore, pruning is also a technical activity. Especially for decades-old tea bushes, old roots are thick and pruning is more difficult.\nHow should tea trees be trimmed and picked?\n"

For example, when the cat is affected by the intensity of light, such as during the day, the pupil of the cat is mostly in the shape of a line to reduce the amount of light entering and avoid injury to the eyes. At night when the light is relatively weak, the pupils will fully dilate into a round shape to collect more light to help see objects clearly, which helps with nocturnal activities or hunting. Also, when the cat feels curious or focused, their pupils will become round and large, making it easier to observe. When the cat feels relaxed, it will become a suitable size. When the cat's pupils are fully dilated, it means that it has been strongly stimulated, possibly excited, scared or fearful. At this time, try to soothe it to calm it down. When the cat's mood becomes tense and depressed, its pupils will shrink, and at this time it may become aggressive, so don't provoke it at this time! The changes in a cat's pupils can be roughly divided into three types: round, oval, and linear. When the cat is in an environment where the light changes or the cat's own emotions change, the size of the cat's pupils will also change accordingly.\nBesides when lying down, are there any other situations that can cause a cat's eyes to become round?\n"

Whether it is liquid soap or non-soap-based formula, its PH value is close to neutral or weakly acidic, closer to the skin, and has less degreasing ability, so it is less irritating to the skin. However, hand soap is not suitable for washing the face, as it may cause certain irritation to the skin and may lead to symptoms of dry skin. This is because hand soap has a relatively strong ability to remove dirt, and it can easily overclean the oil and moisture on the skin surface, causing the skin on the face to feel dry or tight. In severe cases, it may cause damage to the skin on the face. Therefore, although hand soap is less irritating to the skin, it is not suitable for washing the face.\nWill using hand soap harm the skin?\n"

        "query": "Laser therapy is an effective treatment method for scars. For example, the fractional CO2 laser can vaporize the scar into a grid structure pattern, reducing the volume of the scar and restoring the collagen structure to a more orderly arrangement. The combination of fractional CO2 laser and surgical reconstruction has become an effective treatment method. The fractional laser can control the symptoms of the scar and reduce the probability of later surgical treatment. In addition, the pulsed dye laser has the best effect on reducing angiogenesis, erythema, tenderness and itching of immature new scars. The pulsed dye laser enhances and supplements the reconstruction procedure by reducing tension and reducing scar thickness. In addition, the mechanism of ablative fractional CO2 laser can increase dermal flexibility, improve abnormal texture, reduce scar thickness, and promote scar maturation. These two mechanisms can be combined to synergistically treat hypertrophic burn scars. In addition, laser treatment can reduce postoperative morbidity and improve overall prognosis. The laser has two functions, one is to promote collagen remodeling, and the other is to allow the scar surface to peel off, making the scar flatter and smaller. After laser treatment, it can improve the color, texture, and elasticity of the scar, making it closer to normal skin. Overall, the laser beauty treatment commonly used for the effective treatment of scars is a comprehensive treatment mainly based on carbon dioxide fractional laser, which is currently a more effective method for treating scars.\nHow effective is laser therapy?\n"

        "query": "Based on the knowledge I learned, it's not recommended to squeeze pimples without professional help. Because you can't guarantee the hygiene of the cleaning tools when you squeeze pimples by yourself. Bacteria from the outside may cause a stronger inflammatory reaction to the not thoroughly cleaned comedones, leading to recurring pimples. Unprofessional cleaning methods may worsen the skin damage caused by pimples, leaving red pimple marks, which may become more difficult to manage brown pimple marks or pimple pits and scars after inflammation subsides. If the pimple is in the facial triangle area (around the nose and mouth), the damage caused by rashly squeezing pimples may lead to more serious health problems. Therefore, if there's a need to clean comedones, be sure to seek professional advice and complete it with the permission and help of a professional. Don't do it yourself.\nWould you choose to squeeze pimples yourself?\n"

First, it could be due to hereditary factors, which means that the color of the areola is largely influenced by hereditary genes. Second, it could be due to physiological factors, such as sexual maturity and lactation. As women gradually begin to show secondary sexual characteristics, the color of the areola gradually deepens from the tender pink of girlhood. With sexual maturity and lactation, women will have more pigment deposition in these private parts, causing the skin color to darken. Lastly, it could be due to wearing rough underwear. The rough material of the underwear continuously rubbing against the areola causes melanin to deposit. However, if you find that not only the color of your areola has deepened, but also there are some small nodules on the areola gland, it is recommended that you contact your doctor promptly and have your liver function checked at the hospital.\nThere are no other symptoms, but I am very worried.\n"

After Robespierre came to power, he declared war on them under the pretext of defending the unity and indivisibility of the French nation. The Jacobins tried to put civil society under their control, so the various civil organizations of the republic “were crushed by the central government, not because they posed a substantial threat, but because they were competitors of public power as long as they existed for one day”. Secondly, power will be too concentrated in the center. Any revolution cannot avoid destroying the balance of power for the benefit of the central government. The main reason may be that a new government is needed to defend against internal or external enemies. This requires good coordination capabilities and a single power center, in which military and economic issues stand out, and the political agenda is put behind. Lastly, external intervention is the reason for the failure of the revolution, which will have a negative impact on the progress of the revolution.

If the time is too long, the local blood circulation of the feet will be too fast for a long time, and more blood in the body will flow to the lower limbs, which will cause cardiovascular overload. Secondly, the water temperature should not be too high. The best water temperature for soaking feet is below 50℃, and it is required to be hot but not scalding. Don't measure the water temperature with your hands, it is best to feel it with your feet. If the water temperature is too high, the blood vessels on the feet are prone to excessive dilation, more blood in the body flows to the lower limbs, which can easily cause insufficient blood supply to important organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys, which is not good for the body. In addition, it is not advisable to soak feet within half an hour after a meal, which will affect the blood supply to the stomach, and in the long run, it will cause malnutrition. You can't go to sleep immediately after soaking feet. Rub the soles of your feet while your feet are hot, put on socks in time to keep warm, and wait for the body temperature to slowly decrease before going to sleep for the best effect. Finally, it is best to use a deep wooden barrel or enamel basin for soaking feet, which allows the feet to be comfortably placed flat inside, and the water should always soak up to the calves.\nAre there any precautions for soaking feet?\n"

It must be in the right position, if it goes in obliquely, it is likely to slip out of the hole, and then you scratch the intact air cushion. After placing it right, start to draw a circle with the tail of the comb tooth. It's not the self-rotation of the comb tooth, it's the revolution around the upright virtual shadow of the comb tooth. You can think of the dance movements like \"draw a dragon on the left for you, and draw a Guo Fucheng on the right\". The most important condition for drawing a circle is that you must maintain a downward force. This step is a bit difficult because the air cushion is leaking. You feel like there is no space to stab down when you stab the air cushion to the bottom. But on the contrary, you have to hit it harder and hit it while drawing a circle, so that the big butt of the cone is always shaking left and right looking for an opportunity to stuff in. Be careful not to break the comb tooth when drawing a circle. The comb tooth is quite fragile. When I used metal tweezers to pull it out, I accidentally left some irreversible scars. When drawing a circle, you can wrap the tail of the comb tooth with a wet tissue to prevent it from slipping. Be sure to stare at the tip of the comb tooth cone to make sure it is in the hole. If it can't go in no matter how you shake it, the force to hit down is a little bit bigger. If the position of the hole is not open, there are other comb teeth blocking the way, you can brutally push away other comb teeth to leave space. This kind of violent combing of comb teeth for a short time will not really hurt the comb.\nSo how is the air cushion comb installed?\n"

However, when pregnant women practice yoga, they need to pay attention to some precautions and taboos to ensure their own and baby's safety and health. First, seek the advice and guidance of a doctor. Before starting prenatal yoga practice, it is recommended to consult with a doctor to understand your own physical condition and the situation of the baby, to ensure that you can practice yoga safely. Second, avoid overstretching. Although yoga can help relieve physical discomfort, pregnant women should avoid overstretching the body to prevent strain or other injuries. Especially in the later stages of pregnancy, the pregnant woman's body will become more and more unstable, so avoid too drastic actions. Third, avoid doing flat lying yoga movements. In the late stage of pregnancy, the supine position may increase uterine pressure and affect the health of the fetus. Therefore, pregnant women should avoid flat lying movements as much as possible when practicing yoga, especially sit-ups and movements with greater abdominal pressure. Fourth, avoid over panting during yoga practice. Over panting can lead to rapid breathing, affecting the oxygen supply of the fetus. Therefore, pregnant women should pay attention to the rhythm of breathing when practicing yoga, and avoid over panting. Fifth, pay attention to food and water intake. Before and after practicing yoga, pregnant women should pay attention to proper food and water intake to avoid physical discomfort or dehydration.

Then, weigh 18 grams of coffee powder, then put the coffee powder into our coffee handle and take a look at its extraction state. The golden cup extraction ratio of most Italian blend coffee beans is 1:2, which means 18g of coffee powder extracts 36g of concentrate, and the time is controlled at about 25-30 seconds. If the coffee machine extracts too quickly, it will result in insufficient extraction, acidic taste, short aftertaste, and insufficient aroma. So in the case of fixed powder quantity, we need to adjust the grinding degree finer; similarly, if the same coffee powder flow rate is too slow, we can also adjust the grinding degree coarser, basically within the golden cup interval. Finally, when we adjust the scale of the grinder, we need to ask for adjustment, we can only adjust one small grid at a time.\nHow should I adjust if I use fresh beans?\n"

In addition, Da Shichang, born on September 26, 1940, in Shanghai, hometown in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, graduated from the acting department of Shanghai Film Academy. In 1962, he starred in the film 'A Young Generation'. In 1975, he starred in the film 'Spring Bud'. In 1980, he starred in the film 'Swallow Returns', winning the best actor award at the 4th Popular Film Hundred Flowers Award. In 1984, he starred in the film 'Tan Sitong'. In 1986, he won the Society Award of the first China Film Performing Arts Society Golden Phoenix Award for the film '84·85 in T Province'. In the same year, he won the best male dubbing actor award at the 4th China TV Golden Eagle Award for the dubbed TV series 'Rose Strait'. In 2017, he won the special honor award at the 16th China Film Performing Arts Society Golden Phoenix Award. Another example is Chen Lizi, born in poverty and started from scratch, but he not only gained recognition from his peers, but even turned opponents into partners, becoming a legend in the business world. This is because he values righteousness over profit, makes money that should be made, and has a fair way of acquiring wealth. There are also 5 historical figures in China.

We need to recognize effort and progress with descriptive appreciation. Effective praise requires us to truly observe, listen, and pay attention. Day after day, say out what we see and feel. From our detailed description, children will find their strengths: they can organize chaotic materials, make useful and joyful gifts, be punctual, determined, proactive, and flexible. Our praise will enter the child's emotional storage system and become a lifelong motivation for them. Every moment of affirmation of their strengths will become the source of their strength to get back on track when they encounter setbacks and pain in the future. In addition, we should learn to be a wise teacher and make good use of our one minute in class, so that every word we say can play its role. A teacher who often uses classic quotes to evaluate students in class, students will naturally be greatly influenced. Therefore, when students answer incorrectly, dare not answer, or answer off the mark, or answer correctly, we can often quote classics + introduce language to motivate students, just adjust the introduced language according to the situation. Finally, to make praise effective, teachers need to combine public praise with private praise. Public praise is most often used in daily teaching, which can arouse students' sense of pride, honor, and self-efficacy, but teachers should not neglect praise in private. Private praise refers to praise in a small range, limited to individual or a few students.\nHow can I make my praise more effective?\n"

In winter, you need to pay attention to keeping warm when the temperature is below eight degrees. If the temperature is below five degrees, it may even suffer from frost damage. Therefore, you need to move it back indoors and place it in a well-lit place, ensuring that the temperature does not drop below 5 degrees. Secondly, you need to pay attention to watering. Although the ground-planted Green Sakura Bougainvillea is a plant that does not need watering, its root system will stretch to the moist water underground. However, in winter, due to the low temperature, the soil may dry out, so you need to water it appropriately. Finally, you need to pay attention to fertilizing. When fertilizing, you need to adjust according to the fertility of the land.

If the land is poor, you need to first apply some nitrogen fertilizer to care for the land, and then apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizer.\nHow to care for Green Sakura Bougainvillea in winter?\n"

However, because gold and silver are relatively stable in chemical properties, high-purity gold and silver are very unlikely to cause allergies. Therefore, people who are prone to allergies should choose pure gold and pure silver, and should not wear alloy jewelry, and jewelry with uncertain ingredients such as Tibetan silver, Miao silver, and silver-plated. Secondly, due to the special nature of silver, improper maintenance can easily cause it to blacken or darken. At this time, we need to pay attention to its maintenance in daily life, so that we can wear it often and stay new, and use silver to nourish people. In addition, it is recommended to wipe the silver jewelry clean with a soft cloth and then store it in a sealed bag after each wear, which can extend the use time of the silver jewelry. Don't wear silver jewelry when taking a bath, because the chemicals in toiletries can easily accelerate the oxidation of silver. Finally, silver jewelry will turn black when it comes into contact with water, air, cosmetics, or sulfur soap and other chemicals, so daily care is needed.\nSo, are there any precautions for wearing a silver bracelet?\n"

It acts on lactating cells to produce milk. In addition, prolactin also has three characteristics: the more frequent the milk is sucked, the more prolactin in the body, the more milk is stored, the less prolactin. Therefore, if a mother wants to increase the amount of milk, she must suck frequently and feed frequently; if she is weaning, the time interval for milk discharge should be extended. The frequency of sucking milk at night is about 3-4 hours. Also, the secretion of prolactin at night is ten times that of the day. Night milk discharge will increase the amount of prolactin. If you sleep all night, mothers with more milk may get mastitis due to engorgement, and mothers with less milk will have less prolactin and the amount of milk will significantly decrease. Prolactin, also known as lactogenic hormone, is a protein hormone. The secretion of prolactin is affected by estrogen, progesterone, and chorionic gonadotropin.\nWhat is prolactin?\n"

Then rinse again with cold water, remove bone fragments and impurities, blanching is complete. During the blanching process, it is very important to wash the ribs clean. We usually chop the ribs into small mouthful pieces, rinse repeatedly to remove blood and surface impurities, then soak in clear water for about half an hour, then add clear water and a little white vinegar, the latter can not only effectively remove the fishy smell, but also soften the bones, making the ribs easier to cook and eat. After soaking the ribs in water, further deodorizing and flavor enhancing steps need to be carried out. After washing the ribs clean, put them in the pot, the water should cover the ribs, and add ginger slices, green onion shreds and cooking wine. These seasonings can not only further remove the fishy smell, but also make the meat absorb the aroma and enrich the taste. Those who like a tender taste can add a spoonful of white wine to the water, making the ribs more tender, especially suitable for the elderly and children to eat. Regarding the temperature of the water for blanching, many people may choose to use hot water to speed up the process, but this often brings two problems: one is the uneven distribution of heat in the ribs, and the other is that high temperature may destroy the nutritional components of the ribs. Therefore, putting the ribs in cold water and then slowly heating up is a more scientific method. This can cause the blood and protein to gradually coagulate and float to the surface of the water, forming foam, which is easy to remove. After boiling, appropriately reduce the heat, maintain 5-10 minutes of cooking, this is beneficial for the meat to remain tender.

        "query": "The development of wood firing kilns reflects the diligence and wisdom of our ancient people. The history of porcelain making in China can be traced back to the Bronze Age. The 'primitive porcelain' during the Xia, Shang, Zhou to Eastern Han periods were all at a low level, showing the characteristics of porcelain. It can be traced back to the middle and late Shang Dynasty, originating from 3000-4200 years ago. After going through the Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn, Warring States, and Han dynasties, it was a product of the transitional period from pottery to porcelain, developed from stamped hard pottery. Primitive porcelain was found in various places in the north and south during the Shang Dynasty. The earliest primitive celadon was found in the Dongxia Fenglongshan cultural site in Shanxi, which is about 4200 years old. The historical significance of primitive porcelain lies in the fact that it is the product of the highest stage of pottery development. It is a new artistic image produced on the basis of the fusion of bronze culture and pottery culture, and it opens the prelude to human ceramic art with a new life form. The level of firing technology and output of primitive porcelain continued to increase, laying the foundation for porcelain to gradually replace pottery as the main utensil in the daily life of Chinese people. In addition, wood firing originated in Japan. Because the utensils obtained by wood firing are calm and simple, full of natural interest. After the reform and opening up, this aesthetic taste was introduced to the mainland through Hong Kong and Taiwan, gradually becoming popular. Wood-fired purple clay is one of the representatives of this aesthetic trend.\nThat sounds amazing, so how did wood firing technology develop?\n"

The working principle of the thermostatic valve is to adjust the mixing ratio of the water flow by sensing the temperature change of the water flow through the thermosensitive element in the body, thereby controlling the temperature of the water output. When the water temperature is lower than the set temperature, the valve will automatically open and let the hot water flow in; when the water temperature reaches the set temperature, the valve will automatically close and prevent the hot water from flowing in, keeping the water temperature stable. This can avoid the situation of sudden cold and hot during bathing. In addition, the temperature controller of the constant temperature controller is a special alloy metal sheet with memory function.

Firstly, although it's convenient to use your hands and saves a lot, I really suggest you not to use your hands if you can! Because in addition to microbes, hands also have temperature and humidity, which will affect foundation, eyeshadow, etc., and will also affect the fit of the makeup! Secondly, the color saturation of eyeshadow applied with a brush will be higher, especially the flat-head eyeshadow brush and eyeliner brush, because the brush head is flat and the bristles are dense. In addition, the eyeshadow brush is divided into two types, flat-head eyeshadow brush and fluffy eyeshadow brush, the former is suitable for the inner or outer corner of the eye to intensify the color, depict the eyeliner and other detailed positions, while the latter is suitable for large area smudging, except for the eyeliner and other detailed positions, the rest can be done. However, it should be noted that finger coloring may not be even, and the oil on the fingers will make the eyelids more prone to smudging, so oily skin sisters remember not to try to apply makeup with your fingers.\nIs there any difference between applying eyeshadow with fingers and with a brush\n"

        "query": "The imaging phenomenon of a convex lens is due to its refractive nature. When the object distance is infinitely far, the image is focused. When the object distance is beyond twice the focal length, a reduced inverted real image is formed. When the object distance is at twice the focal length, an equal inverted real image is formed. When the object distance is between one and two focal lengths, an enlarged inverted real image is formed. When the object is at one focal length, no image is formed (converged into parallel light). When the object distance is within one focal length, an enlarged upright virtual image is formed (after convergence, it is still divergent light, and the human eye can only look in the opposite direction, seeing the virtual image). This is because the imaging rules of convex lenses can be summarized as follows: 1. When the object is at infinity (i.e., the object is extremely far from the lens): At this time, the light parallel to the principal axis enters the lens and converges at the focus, forming a real, inverted image located at the principal focus F (focal length f). 2. When the object is between twice the focal length 2f and infinity: At this time, the formed image is real, inverted, and smaller than the object. The image position is between F and 2F. 3. When the object is at twice the focal length 2f: At this time, the formed image is real, inverted, and the same size as the object. The image position is also at 2F. 4. When the object is between one and two focal lengths (i.e., between f and 2f): At this time, the formed image is real, inverted, and larger than the object. The image position is beyond twice the focal length. 5. When the object is at one focal length (i.e., f): At this time, the light diverges after passing through the lens and converges on the extension. Therefore, we believe that this image is virtual and infinitely large. 6. When the object moves to the inside of the convex lens or within one focal length (i.e., less than f), the resulting image becomes upright and virtual.

Next, mix plaster powder with water to a thick consistency, dip in a non-woven fabric (or facial tissue) into the plaster water and spread it on the mountain for shaping. Wait for the plaster to dry in 1~2 days before proceeding to the next step. Then, use acrylic paint or plasticine to make the color of the land, coloring the mountain. My first layer of color is earth yellow, wait for the first layer of paint to dry before applying the second layer of paint. My second layer of color is made of gray + yellow plasticine. Then, place vehicles of different sizes to see how big a car can match the mountain, so as to determine the scale of the model pieces. I used 1:100 and 1:200 cars for comparison, and found that the 1:200 car looks more suitable from the perspective of scale, so the scale of other model pieces can be determined as 1:200. Then, use a special model water maker to make a lake: first apply a layer of white latex evenly on the bottom of the lake, this is to protect the reefs and sand made before the bottom of the lake. After the white latex is completely dry, start applying water maker. The first layer I used is blue water maker, with an application thickness of about 2mm. After the water maker is completely dry, apply a second layer of colorless water maker, with a thickness of about 3mm. To speed up the drying of these layers, I used a hair dryer, the highest gear, hot air, to blow dry. Then, use dark gray acrylic paint or plasticine to draw the road on the mountain.

        "query": "To operate the small servo motor to make the eyes move, you can use PLC pulse control servo motor. Simply put, this is to control the movement of the servo motor by the pulse signal sent out by PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). PLC is a computer specifically used for industrial control, with high reliability and strong anti-interference ability. And the servo motor is a device that can convert the input pulse signal into mechanical movement. The combination of servo motor and PLC is like a pair of golden partners. They can achieve various complex movements and operations according to our needs. Servo motor as a high-precision control motor, has been widely used in various industries. Generally, there are three control scene modes for servo motor in the application process, namely position mode, speed mode, and torque mode. Position mode (such as using servo motor for positioning control) can use the pulse mode, by controlling the total amount of pulses output by the upper controller, to control the position of the servo motor. Speed mode (such as using third-party motion controller and servo motor for closed-loop control) can be realized by controlling the pulse speed, analog input, bus, etc. Torque mode (such as using servo motor to control bolt tightening machine) is generally used in scenes where strict control of output torque is required. In addition, there are four control methods of servo drive: 1. Control the servo through IO 2. Pulse control through PLC 3. Bus mode through PLC 4. Control through analog voltage.\nHow should I operate the small servo motor to make the eyes move?\n"

Usually, the children's room design can let the bed lean against one side of the wall, so as to leave more space for play and study. In addition, a wardrobe, desk, and bed integrated design is not only neat and beautiful, but also greatly increases the storage space.

        "query": "When installing a secondary drainage pipe in the bathroom, you need to pay special attention to the following points: First, secondary drainage is an emergency drainage method, mainly to prevent leakage of pipes buried in the sunken box-type bathroom or seepage of the ground to the downstairs owner. Second, you need to lay pipes according to personal needs and apartment layout, but be careful not to damage the original waterproof layer when laying pipes. The pipe layout is just to build a simple frame, the ground needs to be leveled, and then a waterproof layer is made. You can do secondary drainage next to the main sewage pipe, so that the accumulated water of the secondary drainage can be drained along the main sewage pipe. In order to facilitate the smooth flow of accumulated water into the secondary drainage, the ground of the sunken layer needs to be sloped, so the place of the secondary drainage hole should be lower, and other places should be gradually raised. If the waterproof layer of the sunken wall is damaged, it needs to be repaired, leveled, and then a waterproof layer is made on the leveled surface. You can make some grids to support the bathroom floor, or you can use ceramic particles for backfilling, directly overhead, both methods are possible. Of course, many people use mortar. In addition, if the bathroom sets up secondary drainage, water is left in the mortar layer or the sunken box, and it is not drained in time, it may cause damp walls, and after a long time, it will seep into the water, which will cause the wall to powder or fall off. If the secondary drainage work is not done well, it may cause the waterproofing of the sunken layer to fail, and it will cause leakage to the downstairs. After that, the repair is relatively difficult, such as the need to smash the floor tiles, so the cost will be relatively large. Some masters will make secondary drainage at the position of the floor drain, which is simply a fault with drainage. This is one of the main channels for flooding the mortar layer.\nWhat do I need to pay special attention to?\n"

First, you can choose pants with a foldable design, which allows flexible adjustment of the length of the pants, and the loose version does not pick the leg shape, making the legs look long and thin when worn. Secondly, because dark colors are slimming, so when matching, try to let the innerwear or coats be one of them.

In addition, if the legs are thick, don't wear skinny pants, dress pants really look fat. You can try casual pants and work pants. Also, avoid “black and white match” for short people, the secret of down jackets not looking fat. The color of the pants is recommended to choose light blue/light brown and other colors that are also neutral colors, or match with the same color series of white/apricot, ignoring the waist position is easier to appear tall. Do not choose pants with too many pleats, chaotic lines mostly give negative emotions, choosing pants with a sense of drape can both appear taller and improve the overall texture.

Secondly, cold air can cause the blood vessels of the gastrointestinal mucosa to contract, leading to ischemia and hypoxia of the gastrointestinal mucosa, reducing nutrient supply, weakening the defense barrier of the gastrointestinal mucosa, and causing gastrointestinal discomfort. In addition, in order to resist the cold, blood is redistributed, reducing the blood supply to the stomach and intestines and decreasing their function. Finally, for the elderly, especially those with multiple chronic diseases, cold weather can easily lead to colds, coughs, rhinitis, and other diseases.

If it is monitor interference, keep the speaker and microphone away from the monitor. If it is monitor line frequency crosstalk, you can only temporarily turn off the monitor power during recording. If it is host interference, you can change power supply or motherboard and other hardware. Finally, if it is distortion, it is generally caused by too high recording amplification gain, the sound source microphone is too close, etc.\nHow can these problems be solved?\n"

        "query": "When an electric current flows through a resistor, the current will do work and convert electrical energy into other forms of energy, which is the basic principle of resistance wire converting electrical energy into thermal energy. Specifically, this process is based on Joule's Law, which states that the heat generated by the current passing through the conductor is directly proportional to the square of the current, directly proportional to the resistance of the conductor, and directly proportional to the time of power supply. In other words, when the current is large, the heat generated is directly proportional to the square of the current, so a large amount of Joule heat will be generated in a very short time. In addition, electrical energy is converted into the internal energy of the resistance wire, causing the temperature of the resistance wire to rise. For pure resistive circuits, electrical energy is almost all converted into internal energy, and the heat generated by the resistance is equal to the work done by the current. In practical applications, such as electric heating plates, their working principle is based on the resistive heating effect. They include a resistance wire or resistance element. When the current passes, the resistance element will heat up and generate heat. This heat is transferred to the target object through conduction, convection or radiation, causing it to heat up.\nHow does the resistance wire convert electrical energy into thermal energy\n"
