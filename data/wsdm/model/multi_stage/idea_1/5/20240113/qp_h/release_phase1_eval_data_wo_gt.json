Secondly, the best way to make a child obey is to first listen to the child. Listening to them is demonstrating the power of listening and teaching them how to listen. Listening to children will help them release intense emotions. Most importantly, the important basis for cooperation is to be listened to. Therefore, you need to listen to what they say, observe their actions, and even play games with them is also a way of listening. During the listening process, you need to make sure you are no longer emotional, sit next to the child, respond gently to the child, and do not use the tone of 'I am an adult, I will tell you how to think and what to do'. Finally, truly efficient parenting is to let the child 'agree' on the basis of acceptance and abide by the rules.\n"

The interface between the wire and the heating wire must absolutely not touch the water. Secondly, you must watch when you are burning, because it actually boils water very quickly, it takes about ten minutes for me to fill a bucket. The most important point is that you must not touch the water directly when boiling water, you absolutely can't. To feel the temperature, you can dry your hands and lightly touch some parts of the outer perimeter of the container (as far away from 'RÃ¨dÃ©kuÃ i' as possible). Another point, absolutely do not dry burn, easy to explode and short circuit. After putting the 'RÃ¨dÃ©kuÃ i' in the water, the water should almost cover the heating wire to the plastic, but it can't touch the electric wire, and then plug it in.\n"

This can help us intuitively see the difference between each color, making it convenient for us to accurately select the color we need when coloring. When choosing colored pencils, the first thing to look at is the color rendering degree, the second is overlay color, and the third is smoothness and delicacy. For beginners, oil-based colored pencils are a good choice for practice. In terms of color matching, the important thing is the distinction between grass and cloud lines, and there will be no subsequent problems once the overall tone color is determined, and then just some creative color paving and point-view trees. For example, you can use red to match green, take out all red series, and all green series, and arrange them according to the numbers on the pencils, so the comparison is clearer. If there are no numbers, you can also arrange them randomly, it does not affect the effect.\n"

        "query": "So how can you tell if someone is lying?\nTo determine whether someone is lying, we can observe their body language and eyes. Liars tend to show blushing, nervousness, sweating, not daring to look directly, restlessness, etc. when they lie and are questioned, and even have some small movements, indicating that they are very nervous. Liars will deliberately correct their actions, for example, when they are surprised, they will maintain a surprised expression, rather than return to normal in a second. Liars will deliberately make their description of what happened very smooth, and even embellish it, but often the real things need time to recall, to accurately express. When judging whether a person is lying, observing their body language and eyes is a common technique. For example, frequent hand movements touching the face, lips or nose; clenching fists, grabbing objects or their own body; crossing fingers, rubbing palms and other nervous hand movements; stiff body, shrinking, avoiding eye contact; small body shaking or leg shaking unnatural movements; avoidance of gaze: frequently avoiding direct eye contact or changing the focus; pupil changes: pupils dilate or shrink, although this may be due to changes in light or emotion; blinking frequency: increase or decrease in blinking frequency, especially in situations inconsistent with usual. These observation indicators are called non-verbal clues in criminal investigation methods and can be part of the clues, but these indicators alone cannot determine whether a person is lying. In criminal investigation methods, these observation indicators are usually combined with other evidence and technical means, such as facial expression analysis, voice analysis, behavior analysis, etc., to comprehensively judge whether a person is lying.\n"

        "query": "So how should I accurately measure the size of the bedroom door?\nTo accurately measure the size of the bedroom door, you can follow these steps: First, round along the wall, confirm all hole names and mark the opening direction. Then, measure the hole size and write it on the wall with a marker. Next, copy all measurement data to the form and take photos of all holes on both sides. Finally, add names to all photos. For the measurement of the door hole, you need to actually measure the width and height of the door hole, and see if the upper, middle, and lower parts of the door hole are consistent. If they are not consistent, take the narrowest part as the standard, but the error should not exceed 20mm. Also, measure the thickness of the door hole wall at the upper, middle, and lower parts to see if the thickness of the wall is the same. At the same time, see if the thickness of the left and right walls and the thickness of the top wall of the door hole are the same. If they are not the same, take their maximum value, but the error should not exceed 5mm. If the wall thickness error exceeds 5mm, it needs to be corrected. If the wall is a T-wall, a false wall with a width of 50-60mm needs to be made with plywood to place the door casing. The thickness is the same as the wall thickness. The thickness of the door hole wall should not be less than 80mm. The strength of the door frame with a size lower than 80mm is not very high, and the support for the door is not enough. If it is less than 80mm, the thickness of the wall needs to be increased to more than 80mm. When there is a protruding beam on the door hole, the upper door casing cannot be installed. A false wall with a height of 50-60mm also needs to be made with plywood, which is the same length as the width of the door hole and the same depth as the thickness of the door hole. If there are steps in the door hole, the face casing on the side with steps should add the height of the steps, and the specific size depends on the height of the steps. The thickness of the toilet and kitchen door hole wall must pay special attention to the thickness of the wall tiles on the wall. Generally, single-sided tiles are 25mm thick, and double-sided tiles are 50mm thick. The specific situation is confirmed by the designer, customer, and renovation company. The final size should include the thickness of the wall tiles. It is best to measure after the wall tiles are pasted. Pay attention to the opening direction of the door when measuring. The definition of the opening direction is: looking from the front of the door, the hinge is on the left for the left opening, and the hinge is on the right for the right opening.\n"

Children of this age can be taught to check their vision, can cooperate with their parents to persist in training, and at the same time it does not interfere with learning. However, if it is discovered too late, don't blindly give up training. There are also many successful cases of 12-year-olds who have been able to rid themselves of amblyopia through traditional + software training methods. Therefore, even if it is discovered after the age of 12, there is still hope for recovery with the right training methods. It should be noted that after the age of 12, it is difficult to treat it once the optic nerve is fully developed. Therefore, the timing of amblyopia treatment is very critical. During the visual development stage of children, the brain's plasticity is stronger, and the response to treatment is also better. Before the age of 12 is the golden period for amblyopia treatment, because during this period, the child's visual system is still in development, and the brain's adaptability to visual information is stronger.\n"

These two letters are the biggest difference and the key to pronunciation. Secondly, you need to master the pronunciation method of prenasal and nasal sounds. For example, prenasal sound n is a nasal lateral sound that returns to the nasal cavity, so prenasal sounds need to feel the vibration of the nasal cavity. When pronouncing prenasal sounds, the air is sent forward, and the mouth shape opens and closes. Nasal sound g is a root tongue sound, our pronunciation position will be relatively backward, and the point of force is the root of the tongue, when pronouncing, the opening of the mouth will be relatively large.

        "query": "So how can cockroaches be eradicated completely?\nTo completely eradicate cockroaches, you need to follow three steps. The first step is to find the cockroach nest. The second step is to change the home environment, which is a very important factor. Most places where German roaches are noisy at home are typically dirty and messy indoor environments, lots of things, and they don't pay attention to hygiene. Food and snacks are everywhere, and they are lazy at first glance. So if you want to eradicate cockroaches, you must throw away the things that should be thrown away at home, especially the things that have not been used for two years. Don't hesitate to throw away and turn your home into a place where cockroaches like to hide. The third step is to use the right tools and methods to kill cockroaches. For example, pyrethroid insecticides can adhere to the sprayed objects to form a drug film on the objects and stay for a while. This pyrethroid effective component film has an avoidance effect on cockroaches. Then, the probability of cockroaches going to eat gel bait on the drug film will be greatly reduced. In addition, fipronil is a third-generation nicotinic insecticide that is very friendly and low-toxic to mammals. Its ld50 toxicity is lower than that of salt. After being dissolved in water, it can be sprayed on sofas, carpets, floor mats, etc., and a touch-kill drug film with a lasting effect for several weeks can be formed after drying.\n"

        "query": "Can I use ice compress if the swelling is severe?\nYes, you can use ice compress to alleviate the swelling. When soft tissues of the human body are injured, swelling will occur, which is caused by the exudation of soft tissues after injury. At this time, if local cooling is applied to the injured area, it can cause various ducts in the soft tissue to contract, reducing cell metabolism, and thus the exudate will also be reduced. The ice compress can have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and swelling-reducing effects. It is recommended to apply ice for 5 minutes at a time, apply it again after a 10-minute interval, and apply it 3-5 times a day depending on the pain. As for how many days it should last, since ice has no side effects, it can be used throughout the recovery period, but the frequency of ice application should be adjusted according to the individual's condition. Each ice application time is controlled at 15-20 minutes, if the swelling is more serious, you can apply 3-4 times a day, each interval 2-3 hours, the interval time is not recommended less than 1 hour.\n"

Especially for adolescent athletes, stretching is like a nutritious breakfast, providing the necessary 'nourishment' for your muscles, allowing you to perform at your best during exercise. Stretching after physical training not only helps muscles relax and reduces pain after exercise, but also helps prevent sports injuries. If you do not stretch properly after tiring exercise, your muscles will remain tense, which can easily lead to muscle fatigue, stiffness, and even possible sports injuries. In addition, stretching after exercise is different from before, it requires static stretching to relax the tense muscles. You need to relax when your body temperature is hot, don't wait for people to sweat and cool down before stretching. Stretching when the body temperature is hot will stretch more open.

You must bring a nanny and a shield. In addition, if you don't have Wanye, you can change to Wind Lord or Little Deer, and water plus ice can freeze the little treasure and the little monsters at the beginning. When playing rock-paper-scissors, the attack range will be shown on the ground, just dodge. If it's a drill head or a wall that closes in a snap, or a vertical array, it's the same. When it shoots lasers around, the core in the middle will be exposed, you can run to the middle to attack, but you have to run out after a while, because it will suddenly close. If the time is too long, a circle of pillars may appear to trap you, just break one and you can get out. When destroying the prism, it is recommended to use fire, such as Amber's charged attack, Yanfei's heavy hit, and Xiangling's ultimate.\n"

Its composition includes the natural properties of natural objects, such as shape, color, sound, lines, and the harmonious unity of various parts, which are necessary conditions for the formation of natural beauty. Secondly, when natural objects establish a specific aesthetic relationship with people in practice, they have human social content, confirm human essential power, adapt to human living needs, and are beneficial and harmless to people, they are beautiful to people. Finally, the main feature of natural beauty is that it emphasizes the physical form of nature, arouses human aesthetics with the sensory form of nature, and its highest form of expression is the beauty of the human body: that is, the beauty of the human body structure. Natural beauty is a subject of human aesthetics, the source of beauty, and one of the objects of artistic expression.

Second, the temperature and humidity in the baby's room should be appropriate, avoid the baby getting cold and excessive sweating. Being in a damp environment for a long time at low or high temperatures will increase the cough. Third, ensure a balanced diet every day, eat a moderate amount of vitamin-rich foods, such as tomatoes, carrots, lemons, etc., and insist on drinking enough water, which is beneficial to physical health and also helps to enhance the baby's resistance. Fourth, avoid smoke, second-hand smoke and air pollutants, these harmful substances will stimulate the baby's respiratory tract, causing the baby to cough frequently. Fifth, the baby's body needs sufficient sleep to maintain normal functioning. Enough sleep also helps to enhance the baby's resistance and reduce the chance of the baby getting sick. In addition, keep the indoor air fresh, exhaust the kitchen smoke, and parents should not smoke in the house. Ventilate regularly. The indoor humidity should be appropriate, an overly dry environment, the air humidity drops, the mucosa dries and becomes brittle, small blood vessels may rupture and bleed, ciliary movement is restricted, which can easily lead to dry cough. Therefore, when indoors, it is appropriate to maintain a certain humidity. In fact, this is not difficult. When the climate is dry, you can often use a damp mop to mop the floor, or sprinkle some water on the floor. Or place a humidifier at home, but be sure to wash it regularly. Adjust the room temperature, add or reduce clothes for the baby in time. 25â~28â is the most comfortable room temperature. When the baby has a dry cough, spicy foods such as chili, pepper, and ginger should be avoided. These foods stimulate the respiratory tract and worsen the cough, so they should be avoided. Fresh vegetables such as greens, carrots, tomatoes, etc., can provide a variety of vitamins and inorganic salts, which are beneficial to the recovery of body metabolic function, and the baby can eat more. Drinking more water can promote urination and remove bacteria from the body, which can prevent colds and coughs. In addition, mothers should let children exercise appropriately. Strengthen the child's physique, adapt to the cold and dry environment in winter.\n"

For round face, you can choose to layer the front hair area to break the round feeling, and use hard-textured accessories to lengthen the face ratio.

For long face, you can choose to pull the face ratio horizontally on both sides, weaken the presence of the forehead, control the height of the top of the head, focus on the fullness of the two ends, use full backward curling to handle the bangs, extend the hair ends outward in the middle of the face to balance the face shape, and use earrings to horizontally lift the visual shortening of the face shape. For heart-shaped face, avoid heavy straight bangs, use outward curls, air bangs and eight-character bangs to modify, and increase the sense of volume of the lower jaw.

You can put the cat house in a sunny place and let the cat sunbathe more during the day, which can also promote calcium absorption.

This is exactly where these BackBackGoods squeeze. On the other hand, this squeezing on the back will cause the scapula to retract and move the entire chest cavity, creating shear force and compensation.

However, according to the current understanding, mothers can wash their hair and bathe after a certain period of time after delivery. For example, mothers who have given birth vaginally can wash their hair and bathe 1 week after discharge, and mothers who have undergone cesarean section are recommended to bathe 10~15 days after delivery, but they must pay attention to waterproofing the wound to prevent infection. Generally speaking, according to the body's recovery, the general vaginal delivery can wash hair a week after, and two weeks after cesarean delivery. In addition, it's not hygienic and unscientific to not wash your hair in such hot weather during the confinement period, it's easy to breed bacteria and it's not good for health. Therefore, you can wash your hair 1~2 weeks after delivery, but you need to pay attention to the following when washing your hair after delivery: Firstly, you should pay attention to cleaning the scalp when washing your hair. Secondly, the water temperature for washing hair must be appropriate, not too cold or too hot. The hair is more oily after delivery, and it is also easy to lose hair, so don't use too stimulating shampoo. Finally, after washing your hair, you should dry your hair in time, use a hair dryer to dry it, and avoid catching cold.\n"

Mature forest tea trees mainly use light trimming and deep trimming measures to maintain the vigorous growth of tea trees and the neat crown picking surface, ensuring tea yield and quality. Aging tea trees mainly use heavy pruning and terracing measures, combined with shaping pruning and top-light picking to rejuvenate the tea tree crown. In terms of picking, there are standard picking, timely picking, batch multiple picking, and leaf retention picking. Hand picking includes pinching (breaking), straight picking, double-hand picking, and machine picking. The trimming time is generally in mid-to-late April for Longjing 43 tea garden. The spring tea can be pruned immediately after picking. At this time, it is generally heavy repair. The lower the cut, the stronger the bud will be next year. But if the cut is too low, the yield will be low next year. Therefore, pruning is also a technical activity.

The higher this content, the less other sugar and vegetable oil can be added to the chocolate, the healthier the chocolate. Second, look at the hardness and milk fat content. Pure chocolate, such as dark chocolate, has high hardness and less milk fat than milk chocolate, and contains less salt. In addition, we need to distinguish 'cocoa butter' and 'cocoa butter substitute'. Some chocolates, the so-called dark chocolates made with cocoa butter substitutes instead of cocoa beans, don't buy them! Cocoa butter substitute is a type of artificially hydrogenated vegetable oil, it has no nutritional value at all, it will increase bad cholesterol, lower good cholesterol, increase blood viscosity, and thus form thrombus. Finally, we need to pay attention to the packaging, appearance, taste and texture of the product. The genuine product will be softer at room temperature, and needs to be frozen in the refrigerator, because it was frozen after softening, so there are some flaws. The taste and texture of the genuine product are more like raw chocolate, and the filling turns into liquid in your mouth. The overall entrance has a bit of bitter taste, but it is very mellow aftertaste, it doesn't feel bitter, and I still want to eat it after eating.\n"

Installing a layer of screen or curtain on the window can effectively prevent sand and dust from entering the room, breathe fresh air. Secondly, you can use flowers and plants to help. Some plants have dustproof, detoxifying, air-purifying abilities, which can be placed indoors to achieve a dustproof effect. In addition, you can seal doors and windows simply. The aging of window seals will cause a large amount of dust to enter the room, and sticking glass seals around the window glass can prevent dust from entering the room through gaps. Finally, you can use a door and window special seal, a light sticker, which can achieve wind leakage, dust, noise prevention, anti-collision, and solve many problems caused by window gaps.\n"

        "query": "What should we do if the baby's frenulum is too tight?\nIf the baby's frenulum is too tight, there are two main surgical methods to consider. One is the traditional method, which is to cut with a knife. This method is fast and can be operated in the hospital at birth, but it may cause more pain and the recovery period may be longer. Another method is to use a dentist's laser. This method causes less pain and recovers faster, but if the laser is not thorough, it may need to be done again, and insurance may not cover it, and the cost is about $800. After the operation, you need to do stretching exercises, such as stretching the baby's mouth every 4 hours, and revisit in a week. If the revisit shows that the stretching is not done well, the doctor may reopen the wound under the baby's tongue, and it may cause a lot of blood. Therefore, it is recommended to do the stretching exercises seriously after the operation, and also seek help from a chiropractor and lactation consultant.\n"

First, you can use a small amount of water to evenly dip a circle of dumplings in the palm of your hand, and the surface powder will open. Then, gently knead it again. During the cooking process, you need to pay attention to the following points: 1. Put the dumplings in the pot when the pot bottom bubbles. When you see small bubbles coming out of the bottom of the pot, you can put the dumplings in the pot, slightly push the dumplings with the back of the spoon in one direction so that they are not squeezed together, and then use high heat to boil the water. 2. After the pot is boiled, pour in a bowl of cold water, continue to gently stir along the edge of the pot, and be careful not to touch the dumplings. After boiling, add a bowl of cold water again, repeat the operation, add cold water three times in total. Cook until the dumplings float. 3. Take out the frozen dumplings, put them in a large bowl, soak in cold water for 20-30 seconds, and they will not crack due to sudden heat after entering the pot. 4. First boil water in the pot, then pour the dumplings into the pot after the water is boiled. The key point is not to touch it when you cook it. If it is sticking together, you can gently separate them at this time. Then quietly wait for them to float up, and you can immediately scoop them out to cool down after the water boils twice. Finally, put them in the water with ice cubes after a while. Soak it, usually for 3-4 hours, you can change the water in the meantime.\n"

        "query": "Besides when lying down, are there any other situations that can cause a cat's eyes to become round?\nIn addition to when lying down, there are many other situations that can cause a cat's eyes to become round. For example, when the cat is affected by the intensity of light, such as during the day, the pupil of the cat is mostly in the shape of a line to reduce the amount of light entering and avoid injury to the eyes. At night when the light is relatively weak, the pupils will fully dilate into a round shape to collect more light to help see objects clearly, which helps with nocturnal activities or hunting. Also, when the cat feels curious or focused, their pupils will become round and large, making it easier to observe. When the cat feels relaxed, it will become a suitable size. When the cat's pupils are fully dilated, it means that it has been strongly stimulated, possibly excited, scared or fearful. At this time, try to soothe it to calm it down. When the cat's mood becomes tense and depressed, its pupils will shrink, and at this time it may become aggressive, so don't provoke it at this time! The changes in a cat's pupils can be roughly divided into three types: round, oval, and linear. When the cat is in an environment where the light changes or the cat's own emotions change, the size of the cat's pupils will also change accordingly.\n"

The distance of staggered seams should be larger, so it is easier when pulling. Also, the adjustment range should not be too large, otherwise it will easily deform severely. In addition, you can refer to the experience of reducing the size of the T-shirt collar, which has been reduced by about 1.5 cm.

Secondly, don't believe in rumors about passing the exam without preparation. If you want to pass, you need to start reviewing the knowledge points now and practice more lectures and exercises.

Generally, there will be candidates who share the topics in the earlier exam schedule, so you can prepare more. Join a candidate group in advance, candidates who have taken the exam will share this year's new test points and structured questions in it, you can prepare according to others' preparation, the possibility of testing repeated questions is not small. Prepare some lines for communication with students during the trial lecture process, such as: I see that some students have the habit of drawing with a pen in the preview process, very good! As the saying goes, 'Don't move the pen and ink without reading', I hope you can keep such good habits; it seems that students have mastered it very firmly; this student's speech is very logical, do you think he is right; the second group The collected information is very accurate, very good, please sit; the girls in the last row raised their hands early, then please answer this question; there are many posts on the Internet that can be used for reference, you don't need to learn each one, find a few lines to form your own fixed match , You can use it no matter which knowledge point you match. If you don't want to stare at the examiner during the trial lecture, you can choose to stare at the wall in front, but occasionally you should look at the walls on both sides, and it is best to look at the examiner when asking questions during the trial lecture. The voice of the lecture must be loud, even if a sentence is wrong, it can be corrected immediately, don't feel unconfident because of a wrong sentence, after all, real teachers will also stutter when lecturing. Remember to say hello to the examiner when you try to lecture, and then report your candidate number. Remember not to say your name! Don't walk back and forth on the podium, don't kick your feet front and back (some people have the habit of kicking when standing), when pointing to the blackboard or projector, the gesture should be generous, don't appear to want to point and dare not. When inviting students to answer questions, you can also bring some gestures. Finally, remember to write on the blackboard! Don't just focus on lecturing in front.\n"

Whether it is liquid soap or non-soap-based formula, its PH value is close to neutral or weakly acidic, closer to the skin, and has less degreasing ability, so it is less irritating to the skin. However, hand soap is not suitable for washing the face, as it may cause certain irritation to the skin and may lead to symptoms of dry skin. This is because hand soap has a relatively strong ability to remove dirt, and it can easily overclean the oil and moisture on the skin surface, causing the skin on the face to feel dry or tight. In severe cases, it may cause damage to the skin on the face. Therefore, although hand soap is less irritating to the skin, it is not suitable for washing the face.\n"

The ideal state is that the cat does not bite or scratch people, interacts easily, is not nervous or hiding, adapts to visitors, is not overly excited or scared, gets along harmoniously with other cats, is not overly nervous when going out, and masters some tricks to coax people. Secondly, we need to correct the cat's bad habits, such as rummaging through the trash, randomly biting people, scratching claws, urinating and defecating randomly, running around at night, and picky eating. For example, if the cat bites people, we can stuff its throat with our fingers or lightly bite its ears, try not to tease the kitten with our hands. In addition, we can give the cat something to do, divert its attention, eliminate the previous feedback we gave to the cat for playing, let the cat feel that biting us is not fun, but the game is fun. Finally, we need to enrich the environment, divert the cat's attention to us, spend time interacting with the cat, play with it with a cat teaser, play away from our bodies. During the training period, we can wear thicker pants, those who bite people can prepare a knee protector for horse riding. If the cat bites us, we should not have any reaction to the cat at all, ignore it.\n"

        "query": "How effective is laser therapy?\nLaser therapy is an effective treatment method for scars. For example, the fractional CO2 laser can vaporize the scar into a grid structure pattern, reducing the volume of the scar and restoring the collagen structure to a more orderly arrangement. The combination of fractional CO2 laser and surgical reconstruction has become an effective treatment method. The fractional laser can control the symptoms of the scar and reduce the probability of later surgical treatment. In addition, the pulsed dye laser has the best effect on reducing angiogenesis, erythema, tenderness and itching of immature new scars. The pulsed dye laser enhances and supplements the reconstruction procedure by reducing tension and reducing scar thickness. In addition, the mechanism of ablative fractional CO2 laser can increase dermal flexibility, improve abnormal texture, reduce scar thickness, and promote scar maturation. These two mechanisms can be combined to synergistically treat hypertrophic burn scars. In addition, laser treatment can reduce postoperative morbidity and improve overall prognosis. The laser has two functions, one is to promote collagen remodeling, and the other is to allow the scar surface to peel off, making the scar flatter and smaller. After laser treatment, it can improve the color, texture, and elasticity of the scar, making it closer to normal skin. Overall, the laser beauty treatment commonly used for the effective treatment of scars is a comprehensive treatment mainly based on carbon dioxide fractional laser, which is currently a more effective method for treating scars.\n"

For example, you can try this simple recipe: First, peel and chop a clove of garlic. Then, in a small flat-bottomed pan, mix soy sauce, mirin, sugar, sesame oil, and garlic. Heat over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves, which takes about 3 minutes. Stir constantly to help dissolve the sugar and prevent burning. Allow the sauce to cool for about 5 to 10 minutes. Then, use a filter to pour the sauce into a small bowl, separating the garlic slices. Finally, add the ground roasted white sesame to the filtered sauce and mix gently. The barbecue sauce is now ready to use. It can be used for dipping meat and vegetables, or as a sauce poured over the meat.\n"

For stomach diseases, the choice of sleeping position will also affect the recovery of the disease. For example, for stomach ulcers, gastritis, and stomach hypomotility, it is recommended to sleep in the right lateral position. For gastroesophageal reflux, it is recommended to sleep in the left lateral position. In addition, the most suitable sleeping position for stomach pain should be supine, and it can also be combined with hot compress to relieve pain. Relatively speaking, the right lateral position is the most suitable and comfortable sleeping position for the body's blood supply. This position allows the body to naturally bend, the organs to stay in their natural position, the heart to be in a high position without being oppressed and the liver to be in a low position. This can ensure good blood supply, and is also beneficial to the metabolism and healthy operation of the gastrointestinal tract.\n"

Firstly, cut a narrow strip along with the backing paper of the bandage, then tear a small hole, start to pull into the place where the screw is loose, tear off the backing paper while winding. Another method is to use a special screwdriver to adjust the screws of the frame. If it's easy to damage, you can go to the eyeglasses store directly. If both sides are loose, generally bending the bridge inwardly a bit can do. The leg of the glasses is easy to loosen, need to adjust the screw that connects the leg and the frame. Tighten it clockwise with a screwdriver, donât tighten it too much to damage the frame. After adjusting, move the leg by hand, try if the tightness is suitable, you can also try to wear it, and then fine-tune it. The nose pad is easy to feel loose, mainly because it can't hold the bridge of the nose, it's too downward, you can move the metal wire of the bridge of the nose, adjust the tightness inwardly a bit. Finally, we need to check whether the screw of the leg is loose and adjust it in time, and see if there is a phenomenon of expanding outward on the legs. If so, we need to heat the legs with a hair dryer, the temperature should not be too hot, simply heat for a few seconds, and then reshape it!\n"

First, it could be due to hereditary factors, which means that the color of the areola is largely influenced by hereditary genes. Second, it could be due to physiological factors, such as sexual maturity and lactation. As women gradually begin to show secondary sexual characteristics, the color of the areola gradually deepens from the tender pink of girlhood. With sexual maturity and lactation, women will have more pigment deposition in these private parts, causing the skin color to darken. Lastly, it could be due to wearing rough underwear. The rough material of the underwear continuously rubbing against the areola causes melanin to deposit. However, if you find that not only the color of your areola has deepened, but also there are some small nodules on the areola gland, it is recommended that you contact your doctor promptly and have your liver function checked at the hospital.\n"

The rice cake powder must be thoroughly cooked, the detection method is to insert chopsticks into the middle of the flour and open it to see if there is still white dry powder, if so, please extend the steaming time.

            ]
        ],
        "query": "Did these revolutions have any negative impacts?\nThe French Revolution and the Russian October Revolution did indeed have some negative impacts. Firstly, the conflict between the source of power of parliament and party system and the people who hand over power to these representatives led to the emergence of many popular autonomous institutions. After Robespierre came to power, he declared war on them under the pretext of defending the unity and indivisibility of the French nation. The Jacobins tried to put civil society under their control, so the various civil organizations of the republic âwere crushed by the central government, not because they posed a substantial threat, but because they were competitors of public power as long as they existed for one dayâ. Secondly, power will be too concentrated in the center. Any revolution cannot avoid destroying the balance of power for the benefit of the central government. The main reason may be that a new government is needed to defend against internal or external enemies. This requires good coordination capabilities and a single power center, in which military and economic issues stand out, and the political agenda is put behind. Lastly, external intervention is the reason for the failure of the revolution, which will have a negative impact on the progress of the revolution. For example, the failure of the Hungarian Revolution was not due to internal factors, but to the suppression of the Soviet army.\n"

After using a color, the brush head should be washed with water, squeezed dry, and then the next color. Secondly, you need to master the skills of color mixing, first lay out the main color (inherent color) paint on the palette, and then gradually add other colors around the inherent color of the object to form a rich color series that is related and differentiated. In addition, the steps for coloring are: background-table and lining-main object. When painting the main object, start from the light surface, first paint the fixed color, adjust the inherent color, pay attention to the same object should be bright near, slightly dark far away, forming a color space order. If you find that the color is not accurate or the area is not appropriate after painting, don't rush to change it, wait until it is completely dry, and then correct it through coverage. Finally, adjustment can start from the overall coloring, the overall color, gradually and step by step to deepen. Never finish painting an object all at once!! Wait until the entire object parts, gray parts, and dark parts are completed, then deepen the darkest, brighten the brightest, and enhance the gray to achieve a coordinated overall picture effect.\n"

        "query": "Are there any precautions for soaking feet?\nThere are several precautions for soaking feet. Firstly, the time of soaking feet should not be too long, it is best to control within 15--20 minutes. If the time is too long, the local blood circulation of the feet will be too fast for a long time, and more blood in the body will flow to the lower limbs, which will cause cardiovascular overload. Secondly, the water temperature should not be too high. The best water temperature for soaking feet is below 50â, and it is required to be hot but not scalding. Don't measure the water temperature with your hands, it is best to feel it with your feet. If the water temperature is too high, the blood vessels on the feet are prone to excessive dilation, more blood in the body flows to the lower limbs, which can easily cause insufficient blood supply to important organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys, which is not good for the body. In addition, it is not advisable to soak feet within half an hour after a meal, which will affect the blood supply to the stomach, and in the long run, it will cause malnutrition. You can't go to sleep immediately after soaking feet. Rub the soles of your feet while your feet are hot, put on socks in time to keep warm, and wait for the body temperature to slowly decrease before going to sleep for the best effect. Finally, it is best to use a deep wooden barrel or enamel basin for soaking feet, which allows the feet to be comfortably placed flat inside, and the water should always soak up to the calves.\n"

This small filtering bucket is usually a non-powered bucket, mainly used for physical filtering. Its main role is to increase the filtering space. After adding the pre-filtering bucket, the physical filtration and biochemical filtration are separated. The filter cotton is placed in the pre-filtering bucket, and the main bucket is filled with filter material, which is equivalent to increasing the filtering space and enhancing the filtration effect. In addition, the pre-filtering bucket is easy to maintain. Just clean the pre-filtering bucket, and most of the filtering buckets flow water from bottom to top, which means that the physical filtration is at the bottom of the filtering bucket. This means that each time you clean the filter cotton, you need to take out all the filter materials in the entire filtering bucket to clean the bottom filter cotton, and it is too troublesome to operate like this every time.

        "query": "So how is the air cushion comb installed?\nThe installation of the air cushion comb requires some steps. First, you need to put the comb tooth straight into the hole, and the tip of the cone is stuffed in. It must be in the right position, if it goes in obliquely, it is likely to slip out of the hole, and then you scratch the intact air cushion. After placing it right, start to draw a circle with the tail of the comb tooth. It's not the self-rotation of the comb tooth, it's the revolution around the upright virtual shadow of the comb tooth. You can think of the dance movements like \"draw a dragon on the left for you, and draw a Guo Fucheng on the right\". The most important condition for drawing a circle is that you must maintain a downward force. This step is a bit difficult because the air cushion is leaking. You feel like there is no space to stab down when you stab the air cushion to the bottom. But on the contrary, you have to hit it harder and hit it while drawing a circle, so that the big butt of the cone is always shaking left and right looking for an opportunity to stuff in. Be careful not to break the comb tooth when drawing a circle. The comb tooth is quite fragile. When I used metal tweezers to pull it out, I accidentally left some irreversible scars. When drawing a circle, you can wrap the tail of the comb tooth with a wet tissue to prevent it from slipping. Be sure to stare at the tip of the comb tooth cone to make sure it is in the hole. If it can't go in no matter how you shake it, the force to hit down is a little bit bigger. If the position of the hole is not open, there are other comb teeth blocking the way, you can brutally push away other comb teeth to leave space. This kind of violent combing of comb teeth for a short time will not really hurt the comb.\n"

        "query": "What are the specific movements of prenatal yoga?\nPrenatal yoga is a popular exercise for pregnant women, which can not only promote blood circulation, enhance physical fitness, but also relieve some discomfort during pregnancy. However, when pregnant women practice yoga, they need to pay attention to some precautions and taboos to ensure their own and baby's safety and health. First, seek the advice and guidance of a doctor. Before starting prenatal yoga practice, it is recommended to consult with a doctor to understand your own physical condition and the situation of the baby, to ensure that you can practice yoga safely. Second, avoid overstretching. Although yoga can help relieve physical discomfort, pregnant women should avoid overstretching the body to prevent strain or other injuries. Especially in the later stages of pregnancy, the pregnant woman's body will become more and more unstable, so avoid too drastic actions. Third, avoid doing flat lying yoga movements. In the late stage of pregnancy, the supine position may increase uterine pressure and affect the health of the fetus. Therefore, pregnant women should avoid flat lying movements as much as possible when practicing yoga, especially sit-ups and movements with greater abdominal pressure. Fourth, avoid over panting during yoga practice. Over panting can lead to rapid breathing, affecting the oxygen supply of the fetus. Therefore, pregnant women should pay attention to the rhythm of breathing when practicing yoga, and avoid over panting. Fifth, pay attention to food and water intake. Before and after practicing yoga, pregnant women should pay attention to proper food and water intake to avoid physical discomfort or dehydration. It is recommended to drink a moderate amount of water before and after practice, and to eat appropriately after practice to replenish physical strength.\n"

Drinking a lot of water every day, urinating once every 2~3 hours, can prevent the proliferation of bacteria in the urinary tract, and can reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections. Secondly, pay attention to personal hygiene, a large number of bacteria live in the female genitalia and the mouth of the urethra, which is a prerequisite for urinary tract infections. Therefore, you should often pay attention to the cleanliness of the genitals, take more baths, and change your underwear frequently. In addition, try to avoid using urinary tract infection equipment and catheterization, because urinary tract equipment can easily bring bacteria from the distant end of the urethra into the bladder and upper urinary tract, and persistent bacteriuria is easy to occur after catheterization of the urinary tract. Finally, remove chronic infection factors, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and low body resistance, all of which are prone to urinary tract infections.\n"

Secondly, don't believe anything about stewing, the fast cooking in the middle, you don't need to cover the pot, the same rice grains bloom, first: it is not easy to spill the pot, especially the main fat of the rice oil layer will not be spilled out, second is not to let the porridge in the pot be white by the steamed rice soup and rice oil. In addition, when boiling porridge, put enough water in the pot, try not to add water halfway. First boil the water, then put in the washed millet, and boil it. Just after the rice is put, you need to stir the pot from time to time to prevent it from sticking to the bottom, otherwise the porridge will taste bad. Then, turn to low heat, simmer with gentle heat, and try to lift the lid as little as possible when simmering with gentle heat. The boiling time must be enough, at least half an hour, when all the millets are burst open, the soup becomes sticky, you can turn off the heat. Another tip is to wash the millet clean, wash the millet only need to wash 3 times, wash off the surface of the rice powder, the water becomes clear. Let the washed millet soak in cold water for about half an hour, the rice grains will swell, making the taste of millet porridge more pure. When washing millet, stir in a clockwise direction, so the rice grains will become light and will taste better! Boiling millet porridge requires a lot of patience, the first step is to boil the porridge on high heat, keep stirring for about 5 minutes, then turn to medium heat, keep stirring. Because stirring will produce friction, which makes the millet porridge sticky. Finally, turn to low heat, cover the pot for 10 minutes, and the delicious millet porridge is ready.\n"

The cost of fixed assets is determined based on the present value of the purchase price. The difference between the present value and the long-term payable is recorded as 'unconfirmed financing costs'. Because the forklift is purchased with a loan, you need to check the Liability-Loan Account. If there is no Business Loan, you need to change it to Motor Vehicle Loan. Then, you can start keeping accounts. You can enter the purchase of the forklift in the software, and then add the loan, calculate the depreciation, and write the Journal in the software.\n"

After brushing your teeth, pull off the toothbrush head and wipe the waterproof ring and other parts dry with a dry cloth, then place it in a ventilated place. Secondly, regularly change the brush head, which can also better protect the waterproof ring. In addition, to prevent the formation of mold, keeping dry and ventilated is the key, avoid contacting water sources, and avoid exposure to the sun. After each brushing, pay attention to rinsing the gap of the toothbrush installation with clean water to avoid leaving excess toothpaste and causing the waterproof pad to age. Finally, be sure to clean the toothbrush after brushing your teeth to avoid toothpaste residue. Because toothpaste has a corrosive effect, after a long time, it will soak the waterproof ring, and then the toothpaste and water will drive straight in the brush handle, causing damage to the toothbrush circuit and other problems.\n"

Secondly, in the products that can be called collagen peptide, there are also peptides with too large molecular weight, such as 500-2000 Dalton collagen peptide is better absorbed than 1, 2,000 Dalton collagen protein. Therefore, it is recommended to choose 500-2000 Dalton collagen peptide for consumption, because its molecular weight is small, it can be easily decomposed into amino acids by protease in the intestine, and quickly absorbed by the body. In addition, when choosing collagen protein, you need to identify the official raw material brand authorization, clear addition amount, and identify the raw material patent or clinical trial. Finally, the method of consumption is to add 50-100mg milk or VC-containing juice or warm water for daily consumption.\n"

Similarly, echocardiography can check the structure and function of the heart, but it cannot see the condition of the coronary arteries, so it cannot directly detect coronary heart disease. If you highly suspect coronary heart disease, you can consider performing coronary CTA or coronary angiography, which can directly observe whether the coronary artery is narrow, and can perform therapeutic interventional operations during the operation, such as stent implantation and balloon dilation.\n"

Then, weigh 18 grams of coffee powder, then put the coffee powder into our coffee handle and take a look at its extraction state. The golden cup extraction ratio of most Italian blend coffee beans is 1:2, which means 18g of coffee powder extracts 36g of concentrate, and the time is controlled at about 25-30 seconds. If the coffee machine extracts too quickly, it will result in insufficient extraction, acidic taste, short aftertaste, and insufficient aroma. So in the case of fixed powder quantity, we need to adjust the grinding degree finer; similarly, if the same coffee powder flow rate is too slow, we can also adjust the grinding degree coarser, basically within the golden cup interval. Finally, when we adjust the scale of the grinder, we need to ask for adjustment, we can only adjust one small grid at a time.\n"

When choosing a curling wand and clip, for short hair, choose small, narrow tools, otherwise large ones are hard to use and can easily burn your hands. The temperature of the curling wand is also very important, for hard hair, you need a higher temperature, otherwise it is very hard. You can divide your hair into 4 areas first, then use the curling wand to curl the hair in the opposite direction of the earth, the curling strength and length gradually decrease from 1-4, it's best to only curl the ends in area 4. After curling, press down the hair on both temples. Then take an appropriate amount of hair wax in the palm of your hand, rub it evenly and then apply it to all the hair. Finally, if your hair is as hard as mine, you can spray hair gel after, and then use the curling wand to curl again according to the above steps, with the base of styling spray and hair wax, after curling again, even if the hair is as hard as steel wire, it can be shaped according to the direction you want, finally use hair wax to adjust the direction of the hair, spray a layer of styling spray.\n"

During the winter seedling period, ensure adequate light to promote seedling growth. But in the summer, you need to properly shade, avoid direct light, and maintain scattered light. When blooming, appropriately extending the shading time can prolong the flowering period. Second, the leaves of Gloxinia are full of fine fluff, you should avoid the leaves and stems when watering, otherwise if they get wet, it is easy to cause leaf rot. When watering, it is advisable to use the immersion siphon method. Absorbing water from the bottom up can avoid getting the leaves wet and protect the leaves. In addition, prefer fertile and slightly acidic sandy soil, you can evenly mix some coarse sand and decomposed fertilizer in some garden soil. Gloxinia is native to Brazil and is not cold-resistant. The suitable growth temperature is 20 to 25Â°C. When the winter temperature drops to about 5Â°C, Gloxinia will be dormant, and when the summer temperature exceeds 30Â°C, the plant will be semi-dormant.

        "query": "So, are there any examples that prove people from humble backgrounds can also succeed?\nOf course, there are many examples that prove people from humble backgrounds can also succeed. For example, in the show 'Entrepreneurs in China', the story of how a young man from a poor background made a stunning counterattack to become a hotel general manager is impressive. With his tireless efforts and clever mind, he successfully made a breakthrough from zero to a billion. In addition, Da Shichang, born on September 26, 1940, in Shanghai, hometown in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, graduated from the acting department of Shanghai Film Academy. In 1962, he starred in the film 'A Young Generation'. In 1975, he starred in the film 'Spring Bud'. In 1980, he starred in the film 'Swallow Returns', winning the best actor award at the 4th Popular Film Hundred Flowers Award. In 1984, he starred in the film 'Tan Sitong'. In 1986, he won the Society Award of the first China Film Performing Arts Society Golden Phoenix Award for the film '84Â·85 in T Province'. In the same year, he won the best male dubbing actor award at the 4th China TV Golden Eagle Award for the dubbed TV series 'Rose Strait'. In 2017, he won the special honor award at the 16th China Film Performing Arts Society Golden Phoenix Award. Another example is Chen Lizi, born in poverty and started from scratch, but he not only gained recognition from his peers, but even turned opponents into partners, becoming a legend in the business world. This is because he values righteousness over profit, makes money that should be made, and has a fair way of acquiring wealth. There are also 5 historical figures in China. They were all born poor but eventually achieved great things. These include Mao Zedong, Confucius, Sun Yat-sen, Jack Ma, and Zhu Yuanzhang. Their stories show that as long as you are determined and never give up, anything is possible.\n"

The German Mark was the currency in circulation in Germany before the Euro was used in 2002. It was first issued in West Germany after World War II in 1948 and became the currency of the Federal Republic of Germany after the reunification of East and West Germany. This coin is a currency Mark issued in 1983, manufactured by Karlsruhe, now worth 0.51 Euros. The Mark was the legal currency of Germany before the Euro was used in 2002, first issued in Germany under Allied occupation in 1948 to replace the original Imperial Mark, and subsequently served as the legal currency of the Federal Republic of Germany until it was replaced by the Euro in 1999.\n"

Secondly, the four corners are protruding, with holes for phone ropes. In addition, the feel is just like a silicone phone case, but this layer of ripples is quite special.

The magnetic function is also worry-free for daily use with a magnetic power bankð. CASETiFY is increasingly known for its good drop resistance. In terms of lens frame, casetify also leaves a small distance to achieve the effect of lens drop resistance. At the same time, compared with other brands of phone cases, the thickness of the front frame of casetify will increase accordingly, which also increases the weight of the case itself. Finally, the price of casetify is relatively high compared to similar products.

Aquamarine can be divided into 9 grades from high to low quality: light blue in stone form, deep blue in stone form, semi-transparent light blue, shiny light blue, semi-transparent sky blue, semi-transparent water blue, shiny cat's eye, transparent water blue, pure water blue. If the color is pure and bright, and there are no flaws inside, it is of high quality. Aquamarine symbolizes calmness, bravery, and intelligence, and is known as the \"stone of love\". Wearing aquamarine can enhance self-confidence, relieve stress, and make people feel relaxed. In ancient times, people found that aquamarine is like a pool of clear water, blue as the ocean, perfectly combining appearance and inner quality, hence the name \"aquamarine\". Aquamarine can help to calm the mind and clarify thoughts, enhance personal communication skills, strengthen personal confidence, and moisturize the skin. It's recommended to wear the aquamarine on the left hand according to the principle of 'enter from the left and exit from the right'. As a tip, you can wear it with rose quartz or clear quartz to increase their complementary effects. Aquamarine can help relieve fatigue, massage the skin, and improve people's spirits. Wearing aquamarine can also enhance a person's temperament, highlighting a unique personal charm. Aquamarine can also have a skincare effect.

Open your chest cavity to ensure that you can inhale enough air. Then, take 3 deep breaths to help activate your respiratory muscles. Next, pay attention to output steadily for a long time, don't try to suddenly exert force or intermittently exert force to help improve your score. In addition, you can try freestyle swimming training, which can train the respiratory muscles to be more developed, increase the chest circumference, the inhaled oxygen also increases, and the lung capacity is also improved accordingly, making people breathe more smoothly. Also, you can try holding your breath, the principle is very simple. After holding your breath, the body is extremely hypoxic. The body needs to quickly replenish and stimulate the body's limit to achieve the goal. But you must master the correct initial practice method.

On the other hand, if the tire pressure is too low, it may increase friction, thereby increasing power consumption, and the steering may become heavy, and there is also a risk of tire burst. Both high and low tire pressure will affect driving safety. In addition, high tire pressure may cause the friction and adhesion of the tire to decrease, affecting the braking effect; cause the steering wheel to vibrate and deviate, reducing the comfort of driving, increasing the vibration of the car body, indirectly affecting the life of other parts; accelerate the partial wear of the central pattern of the tire surface, reducing the life of the tire; and reduce the rolling resistance. Low tire pressure may increase the friction coefficient with the road, accelerating tire wear and aging, and increasing fuel consumption; cause the steering wheel to be heavy and prone to deviation and other factors that are detrimental to driving safety; the friction between the tire and the ground increases exponentially, the tire temperature rises sharply, the tire softens, and the strength decreases sharply.

When a charged particle accelerates, it will generate changing electric fields and magnetic fields. These fields will propagate outward, forming electromagnetic waves. The direction of propagation of electromagnetic waves is perpendicular to the oscillation direction of the electric field and the magnetic field, and the oscillation directions of the electric field and the magnetic field are also perpendicular to each other. In addition, electromagnetic waves are transverse waves, and their vibration direction is perpendicular to the propagation direction. The nature of electromagnetic waves depends on their frequency or wavelength. The frequency refers to the number of oscillations per second, in hertz (Hz). The wavelength refers to the distance between two adjacent wave peaks or wave valleys, in meters (m). There is an inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength, that is, the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength; the lower the frequency, the longer the wavelength.\n"

Effective praise should be encouragement, not praise. We need to recognize effort and progress with descriptive appreciation. Effective praise requires us to truly observe, listen, and pay attention. Day after day, say out what we see and feel. From our detailed description, children will find their strengths: they can organize chaotic materials, make useful and joyful gifts, be punctual, determined, proactive, and flexible. Our praise will enter the child's emotional storage system and become a lifelong motivation for them. Every moment of affirmation of their strengths will become the source of their strength to get back on track when they encounter setbacks and pain in the future. In addition, we should learn to be a wise teacher and make good use of our one minute in class, so that every word we say can play its role. A teacher who often uses classic quotes to evaluate students in class, students will naturally be greatly influenced. Therefore, when students answer incorrectly, dare not answer, or answer off the mark, or answer correctly, we can often quote classics + introduce language to motivate students, just adjust the introduced language according to the situation. Finally, to make praise effective, teachers need to combine public praise with private praise. Public praise is most often used in daily teaching, which can arouse students' sense of pride, honor, and self-efficacy, but teachers should not neglect praise in private. Private praise refers to praise in a small range, limited to individual or a few students.\n"

        "query": "I want to learn about the grip and hitting first.\nThe grip and hitting skills of billiards are very important. First, when you grab the stick, don't use too much force, keep it relaxed and free. Hold it with three fingers, with the index finger in front of the stick, the thumb behind the stick, and the middle finger lightly placed between the two fingers. This not only feels comfortable but also better controls the force and direction of the stick. Secondly, a stable bridge is a prerequisite for potting. The bridge serves as the third support point of the body, providing a stable channel for the shot and adjusting the hit point of the cue ball. The bridge is also very critical in the hitting process. Finally, keep your forearm relaxed and naturally vertical when gripping, in simple terms, your gripping fingers, arm, elbow joint, shoulder joint all need to be relaxed, so as to exert force. If the posture is stiff and uncomfortable, it will inevitably affect the force and accuracy of the hit. Then lay the cue as flat as possible, at this time your gripping hand, chin, bridge and target ball need to form a straight line, then gently move the cue with your forearm, pay attention to the rhythm, not too fast, make a slight horizontal pull, so that the tip of the cue is close to the hit point of the cue ball, repeat this several times to make the feeling smooth, then you can hit a good ball.\n"

First, you can try positive training, making the rabbit interested in training, completing some simple actions, which is actually a very simple thing. When the rabbit has learned simple commands, you can continue to advance, teaching complex commands such as jump circle, high five, etc., which is also a good way to enhance the relationship. Secondly, you can take the rabbit to the countryside to step on a large grassland, but you must first go around to determine an approximate safe range and divide the danger area. Then put on clothes and tie the leash to ensure that the rabbit can move freely without restrictions, and to avoid losing direction when playing too much. The best way is to use a long retractable leash, let it go to the longest, and then let it run. If the rabbit really runs into the hole, you can step on the leash first, and then slowly guide it back. Finally, the rabbit longs for freedom in a strange environment, it will still be afraid or too wild. So you still have to accompany them, give her enough security, so that she can really play with confidence.\n"

Secondly, prepare a comfortable nest for the cat, such as putting a blanket or a hot water bottle in the nest, to make the cat fall in love with its own nest. In addition, you can use the snack method, train the cat to stay in its own nest, prepare some snacks that the cat loves, or catnip, let the cat know that there are delicious things staying in the nest, and gradually adapt to sleeping in the nest. Also, you can transfer the smell, put things with the owner's smell, such as clothes, hats, etc., into the cat's nest. If you find the cat on the bed, you need to scold it loudly, tell it that it can't sleep on the bed, and you can also slap the cat appropriately to let it recognize its own mistakes. Be careful not to slap the head. Some kittens refuse to get down from the owner's bed because they are too energetic and have nowhere to vent. The owner can play with the cat for an hour or two when they return home from work or during the day. You can choose a cat stick or laser pen, which can consume the cat's energy without tiring yourself. If the cat still gets on the bed after spraying water, you can buy thorns or fences to surround yourself, which is a bit funny. Finally, establish a reward and punishment mechanism for the cat. When the cat sleeps obediently in the nest, reward it with a pack of snacks when it wakes up. If it runs to the bed, there is none.\n"

For example, for a Tesla Model 3, a 2-year or 40,000-kilometer warranty extension costs 7700 yuan; a 4-year or 80,000-kilometer extension costs 14700 yuan. However, if your car has already driven more than 80,000 kilometers, you need to get the car inspected before extending the warranty. In this case, a 2-year or 40,000-kilometer warranty extension costs 11000 yuan; a 4-year or 80,000-kilometer extension costs 21000 yuan. If you buy the extended warranty when buying the car, the price will be cheaper, about 6300 yuan cheaper.

In addition, the normal car wash water pressure is between 4~8Mpa or 40 to 80kg pressure can effectively clean the mud and will not hurt my car paint. For example, some car wash stations adjust the pressure of the car washer to 160bar, and the pressure at stations 2, 3, and 4 is 110bar. For best results, it is recommended to use station 1 with a PA pot spray core â¥1.2, and use stations 2, 3, and 4 for PA pot spray cores 1~1.15. It should be noted that the high-pressure gun water pressure at station 1 is too high, and women who come alone are not recommended to use station 1.\n"

For example, we can use the root measurement method. The plane taken by the root measurement should overlap with the root canal image. When measuring the height of the near-median and far-median alveolar bone, the baseline of the buccal-lingual direction overlaps with the root canal image. When measuring the height of the buccal and lingual alveolar bone, the baseline of the near and far median surfaces should overlap with the root canal of the near and far median surfaces. In this way, the relatively accurate height of the buccal side, lingual side, near median side, and far median side of the alveolar bone can be measured. When the root is curved, it should overlap with the root canal as much as possible in order to measure the actual height of the alveolar bone. Of course, there will be systematic errors.\n"

Secondly, during the use of the multimeter, you should not touch the metal part of the meter pen with your hand. This can both ensure the accuracy of the measurement and also ensure personal safety. In addition, when measuring a certain electric quantity, you should not shift gears while measuring, especially when measuring high voltage or large current. Otherwise, the multimeter will be damaged. If you need to shift gears, you should first disconnect the meter pen, and then measure after shifting gears. The multimeter must be placed horizontally when in use to avoid errors. At the same time, be careful to avoid the influence of external magnetic fields on the multimeter. Finally, after using the multimeter, the conversion switch should be placed in the highest gear of AC voltage.

Every 100 grams of olive oil contains about 73 grams of monounsaturated fatty acids and about 11 grams of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Olive oil also contains a rich amount of vitamin E and other antioxidants, and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. On the other hand, flaxseed oil contains a large amount of Î±-linolenic acid (ALA), which is a polyunsaturated fatty acid. Every 100 grams of flaxseed oil contains about 53 grams of ALA, which is an essential fatty acid that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be ingested from food. Flaxseed oil also contains other polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid and oleic acid, as well as some antioxidants, such as vitamin E and anthocyanins. In terms of taste, olive oil has a relatively strong taste, with a certain bitterness and fruity flavor. Its texture is relatively thick, suitable for cooking and baking, and can also be used as a seasoning. Flaxseed oil has a lighter taste, with a fresh grassy flavor, and its texture is thinner, suitable for use as a raw food oil, for making salad dressings and sauces, etc. In terms of cooking methods, flaxseed oil is not suitable for high-temperature cooking, because it has a high content of unsaturated fatty acids, which can easily oxidize when heated and produce harmful substances. Olive oil, on the other hand, can be used at moderate temperatures, suitable for various cooking methods such as stir-frying and grilling.\n"

How should I alleviate this pain?\nYour lower back pain may be due to the anterior tilt of the pelvis and the tightening of the lumbar muscles. You can try using a knee pillow, which can alleviate the feeling of the lower back hanging in the air for a short time. If you want to improve through exercise, you can do lumbar and pelvic rolling training. In addition, you can try some pre-sleep stretching exercises to relax your tired and tense body, relieve the back pain after exercise or prolonged sitting, and sleep better. Orthopedic doctors recommend doing some movements, such as stretching and bow step squatting. Using muscle stickers is also a good choice, sticking on the waist can relieve the waist soreness. If you frequently have back pain, you can also try to do some exercises, such as twist stretching, left and right leg swing, 9090 abdominal muscle activation, and bear crawl static support. But in the process of exercise, if it causes pain, it is not recommended to continue the exercise, it is best to ask a professional for adjustment after.\n"

        "query": "Do you feed the baby directly after it is cooked?\nAfter cooking the lotus root, it is not directly fed to the baby. Because after adding supplementary food, babies should mainly consume milk, ensuring a daily intake of more than 800ml of milk. Supplementary food is secondary. The main purpose of adding supplementary food is not to supplement nutrition, but to exercise the baby's chewing and swallowing abilities, promote intestinal absorption, and activate taste buds. Therefore, the cooked lotus root needs to be made into a puree or soup, and then fed to the baby.\n"

Blue light can penetrate the skin tissue, and in the short term, it can make the skin easily dim and turn black. In the long term, it can accelerate aging. Specifically, blue light can promote the increase of melanin production, increase the production of reactive oxygen species, making the skin lax and dull, growing spots and fine lines, and even destroy our skin's self-repair function, affecting the secretion of melatonin, so it looks easy to age. In addition, blue light can penetrate the epidermis of the skin, reaching the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, accelerating the loss of human collagen, causing skin aging. The penetration of blue light on the skin is stronger than ultraviolet light, it is the main culprit in causing macula, freckles. Therefore, we need to avoid blue light from the source, such as reducing the use of electronic products, insisting on applying sunscreen, not only against ultraviolet light, but also against some blue light, you can stick a blue light filter film on your computer, tablet, and mobile phone, which can filter out some blue light, after it gets dark, switch your phone to night mode, because usually in this mode, its blue light will be relatively less.\n"

Photon rejuvenation is one of the earliest beauty methods, it can non-invasively solve spots, red blood vessels, red acne marks, superficial wrinkles, and large pores. Although many people worry that doing photon treatment will make the skin thinner, in fact, photon rejuvenation may cause temporary erythema and thin scab formation, but it can recover quickly.

At this time, when you eat staple food, the amount is relatively easy to control and you will not feel more hungry. In addition, you can choose a low GI diet, the staple food is coarse grains. Nowadays, more and more pregnant mothers have gestational diabetes, but it was rare 30 years ago. One of the main reasons is that people eat better now, and they consume too many refined carbohydrates, high sugar and high oil. During pregnancy, it is recommended to reduce refined rice and refined noodles, and replace them with coarse grain rice, corn, purple potatoes, yam, oatmeal and other low-GI staple foods. Finally, you can try to eat vegetables until you are full, and reduce staple food appropriately. Many pregnant mothers with gestational diabetes like to eat a lot of staple food and fruit in the early and middle stages of pregnancy. There is no need to increase the intake of staple food during pregnancy, especially rice, rice noodles, and pasta. You can choose to eat more vegetables, supplement protein, dietary fiber, and you can also feel full. But pay attention to not completely stop eating staple food in order to control weight, ketone rise is more harmful than sugar rise.\n"

First, it is important to note that silver is a heavy metal and can be harmful to the body. However, because gold and silver are relatively stable in chemical properties, high-purity gold and silver are very unlikely to cause allergies. Therefore, people who are prone to allergies should choose pure gold and pure silver, and should not wear alloy jewelry, and jewelry with uncertain ingredients such as Tibetan silver, Miao silver, and silver-plated. Secondly, due to the special nature of silver, improper maintenance can easily cause it to blacken or darken. At this time, we need to pay attention to its maintenance in daily life, so that we can wear it often and stay new, and use silver to nourish people. In addition, it is recommended to wipe the silver jewelry clean with a soft cloth and then store it in a sealed bag after each wear, which can extend the use time of the silver jewelry. Don't wear silver jewelry when taking a bath, because the chemicals in toiletries can easily accelerate the oxidation of silver. Finally, silver jewelry will turn black when it comes into contact with water, air, cosmetics, or sulfur soap and other chemicals, so daily care is needed.\n"

Therefore, a mattress that is too hard or too soft is not suitable for people with back pain. Choosing a mattress of medium hardness can relieve back pain. In addition, the height of the mattress is also important. A mattress that is too high will increase the difficulty of getting on and off the bed, while a low one will cause difficulty in getting up. Both too high and too low are not conducive to waist health. Therefore, choosing a mattress of suitable height can reduce the risk of aggravated back pain symptoms. For example, for people with lumbar disc herniation, the mattress should be of moderate hardness and supportive. In general, a hard mattress is more suitable for people with back pain.\n"

        "query": "So how should we prevent rabies?\nTo prevent rabies, we need to understand the following points: First, the degree of exposure to rabies virus determines the method of treatment. For example, grade I exposure does not require medical treatment, just wash the contact area; grade II exposure requires immediate wound treatment and rabies vaccine inoculation; grade III exposure requires immediate wound treatment, use of rabies passive immunity agent, and rabies vaccine inoculation. Secondly, the method of wound irrigation is to use soap water and pressurized flowing water to rinse the wound for at least 15 minutes. After rinsing, disinfect the wound with iodine or alcohol. The time of using passive immunity agents is as soon as possible, if not used on time, should be used within 7 days of the first dose of the rabies vaccine. The method of rabies vaccine vaccination is intramuscular injection, the vaccination time is 5-dose method: inject 1 dose each on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 28; 4-dose method: 2-1-1, inject 2 doses on day 0, and 1 dose each on days 7, 21.

Before detection, the rebar detector should be preheated and zeroed, and the probe should be kept away from metal objects when zeroing. Before detection, it is advisable to understand the layout of the reinforcing bars in combination with the design data. During the detection, avoid the reinforcing bar joints and binding wires, and initially locate the reinforcing bars to be tested. Move the probe regularly on the detection surface until the instrument shows the strongest reception signal or the minimum protection thickness value. At this time, the centerline of the probe basically coincides with the axis of the rebar, and the thickness of the rebar protective layer can be read. In addition, the multi-functional concrete rebar detector is a device used to detect the quantity, diameter, layout and protective layer thickness of rebars in concrete structures.\n"

When it is basically the same as flat shoes, you can keep your knees straight and walk naturally. The strength of tensing the arch of your foot needs to be adjusted according to the height of the heel. If you tense too much, the front of your foot will touch the ground first. If not enough, the transition from the heel to the front of the foot when landing is not smooth. When tensed just right, walking is as smooth as with flat shoes. Secondly, ankle control is particularly important, stabilize the ankle to stabilize the foot and confidently take each step. In addition, high heels will change the slope of our feet, so when you step out, you don't need to hook your toes, just lightly tense them. When landing, straighten your knees but don't lock them.

Then, when the child starts to cry, you need to lower your voice and communicate with him calmly, giving him face in public. When the child makes unreasonable demands, do not be held hostage by his emotions and demands. Tell him directly that even if he cries, he will not meet his rude demands, and because of such crying, the chance to come out next time will be less. After the child has calmed down, ask the reason for the child's crying and try to solve the problem with him. If the tantrum occurs on the street or in stores and other public places, the only solution is to drag him away from the scene as soon as possible. If the dragging fails, ensure the child's safety and ignore him until he eases, then praise him in time.\n"

For international shipping of large and small-sized paintings, small size paintings can be boxed and sent directly, large-sized works can be disassembled from the back, rolled up and mailed, which can ensure the safety of the works. After receiving the work, the collector only needs to mount it back on the oil painting frame. In addition, the packaging materials can ensure that the works are intact during transportation, and if it has some aesthetic features, it is a very important part. You can use 5-layer hardened cardboard, which is customized by a local offline factory, named 'Heaven and Earth Cover', and two are clamped together during packaging. Cardboard can be customized offline locally to save a bit of 'throwing goods' freight expenditure. You can also use large stretch film to have a dust-proof protective effect, and the transparent texture is also quite aesthetic. Customers who do not want to unpack the painting immediately can keep it for a while. Hand roll film is used to fix the foam corner guard strips, which can be easily removed. In addition, the innermost layer of oil painting packaging is usually pearl cotton, which prevents the painting from sticking to the packaging; then wrap several layers with bubble pads to prevent bumps, and the gaps on all sides should be filled with foam; customize a wooden box that fits the size of the work (slightly larger than the size of the work); make opening marks, handle with care, and other safety tips on the outer wooden box. Finally, send it away by SF Express, and then the work is safely home, and the collectors are waiting for the goods.\n"

It acts on lactating cells to produce milk. In addition, prolactin also has three characteristics: the more frequent the milk is sucked, the more prolactin in the body, the more milk is stored, the less prolactin. Therefore, if a mother wants to increase the amount of milk, she must suck frequently and feed frequently; if she is weaning, the time interval for milk discharge should be extended. The frequency of sucking milk at night is about 3-4 hours. Also, the secretion of prolactin at night is ten times that of the day. Night milk discharge will increase the amount of prolactin. If you sleep all night, mothers with more milk may get mastitis due to engorgement, and mothers with less milk will have less prolactin and the amount of milk will significantly decrease. Prolactin, also known as lactogenic hormone, is a protein hormone. The secretion of prolactin is affected by estrogen, progesterone, and chorionic gonadotropin.\n"

The color temperature in the camera is opposite to the actual color temperature of the light source, which is the working principle of white balance, which compensates by using the corresponding complementary color. There are many modes of white balance, including K mode, scene mode, custom mode, and AWB mode. K mode allows you to manually adjust the color temperature. If you want to be more accurate, you can customize the white balance, which requires you to find a white object and show it to the camera, telling it that the color temperature of this object has become this color in this environment. At this time, the camera will use this white object as a reference to correct the color of the object. In addition, you can also enter the camera menu, choose daylight, shadow, cloudy, etc. according to the shooting environment, or manually set the white balance K value, adjusting the white balance can correct the color of the picture.

Secondly, watering is also very important, normally this temperature (30 degrees in Guangdong) must water once a day. Water thoroughly. When it's just started in winter, water it according to the condition, if it looks a bit soft, water it. In addition, fertilization is also necessary, phosphorus and potassium fertilizer (dihydrogen phosphate or Duo Duo 2) is mainly used, fertilize once with a general fertilizer after pruning, and then continue to use phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. Finally, pruning is also very important, don't think about the waterfall-like six-fold benefit, let's just watch it explode haha. Prune promptly after flowering, be willing to, basically a circular range with the edge of the pot. If it hangs down, it won't be enough to explode, and the top is easy to bald.\n"

When replacing the flower pot, you need to pay attention to the following points: 1, I changed the pot because the pot has weak water storage function, the watering frequency is too high, if you find other signals (the roots are full, stiff seedlings, etc.) you can decisively change the pot; 2, choose a breathable and permeable pot one size larger for the flower pot, donât suddenly change a much larger one, itâs easy to accumulate water and rot roots; 3, choose loose and breathable nutritional soil for the soil; 4, try not to hurt the roots of the green plants when changing the pots, otherwise the green plants will easily yellow leaves or even die; 5, be sure to press the soil tightly, if there are gaps in the soil, the roots will not grow well; 6, for the green plants that like fat, you can apply base fertilizer, autumn begonia can not add; 7, water thoroughly after changing the pot, if the soil collapses after watering, add soil.\n"

Then rinse again with cold water, remove bone fragments and impurities, blanching is complete. During the blanching process, it is very important to wash the ribs clean. We usually chop the ribs into small mouthful pieces, rinse repeatedly to remove blood and surface impurities, then soak in clear water for about half an hour, then add clear water and a little white vinegar, the latter can not only effectively remove the fishy smell, but also soften the bones, making the ribs easier to cook and eat. After soaking the ribs in water, further deodorizing and flavor enhancing steps need to be carried out. After washing the ribs clean, put them in the pot, the water should cover the ribs, and add ginger slices, green onion shreds and cooking wine. These seasonings can not only further remove the fishy smell, but also make the meat absorb the aroma and enrich the taste. Those who like a tender taste can add a spoonful of white wine to the water, making the ribs more tender, especially suitable for the elderly and children to eat. Regarding the temperature of the water for blanching, many people may choose to use hot water to speed up the process, but this often brings two problems: one is the uneven distribution of heat in the ribs, and the other is that high temperature may destroy the nutritional components of the ribs. Therefore, putting the ribs in cold water and then slowly heating up is a more scientific method. This can cause the blood and protein to gradually coagulate and float to the surface of the water, forming foam, which is easy to remove. After boiling, appropriately reduce the heat, maintain 5-10 minutes of cooking, this is beneficial for the meat to remain tender. At the same time, the foam needs to be constantly removed, to keep the soup clean and odorless. After blanching, the ribs should not be stewed for too long, 5-10 minutes is usually enough, too long will make the meat hard. Finally, rinse the ribs with clear water, remove the remaining impurities and foam.\n"

In addition, the cantilever is also the transition between the roof and the wall in the facade of ancient architecture, and it is the symbol of architectural grade. In feudal China, only important buildings, such as palaces, temples, mausoleums, etc., were used on major buildings, so the cantilever also became a symbol of architectural grade. In addition, the cantilever forms a criss-cross paving layer between the beam frame and the column, like adding a spring layer between the beam frame and the column, which can effectively resist seismic forces.\n"

The wood is easy to crack, and the harder the wood, the harder it is to screw in. Even if it does not crack for the time being, it is likely to crack due to thermal expansion and contraction, vibration, and heavy pressure. Choose the right drill bit, the thinnest can be used, too thick is not firm. Limit the depth of the drill hole, you can wrap the drill bit with masking tape, but never drill through the wood. Drill holes at the marked points. Take out the controller and power bracket and other items that need to be fixed, mark the screw positions, and continue to drill. Clean the holes, you can use a vacuum cleaner or brush. Put back the bracket and lock the screws to finish. Finally, the front of the table top faces the ground, the back faces up, pay attention to protect the table top. Put the lifting table leg in position, use a pistol drill (electric drill) to drill a hole about 1mm against the screw hole, then use the self-tapping screw to screw it in and fix it.\n"

                "That's an interesting question. Wood firing is actually a pottery firing technique. Because wood is used as fuel, the color of the pottery produced will be affected by factors such as the wood quality and temperature, usually resulting in different colors and textures."

                "So what's special about pottery fired by wood firing?",
                "Pottery fired by wood firing not only has rich colors, but also has unique textures and color spots on the surface. This is due to the smoke and ash produced by wood burning, which adheres to the pottery at high temperatures. This natural artistic effect is something other firing techniques cannot replicate."

        "query": "That sounds amazing, so how did wood firing technology develop?\nThe development of wood firing kilns reflects the diligence and wisdom of our ancient people. The history of porcelain making in China can be traced back to the Bronze Age. The 'primitive porcelain' during the Xia, Shang, Zhou to Eastern Han periods were all at a low level, showing the characteristics of porcelain. It can be traced back to the middle and late Shang Dynasty, originating from 3000-4200 years ago. After going through the Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn, Warring States, and Han dynasties, it was a product of the transitional period from pottery to porcelain, developed from stamped hard pottery. Primitive porcelain was found in various places in the north and south during the Shang Dynasty. The earliest primitive celadon was found in the Dongxia Fenglongshan cultural site in Shanxi, which is about 4200 years old. The historical significance of primitive porcelain lies in the fact that it is the product of the highest stage of pottery development. It is a new artistic image produced on the basis of the fusion of bronze culture and pottery culture, and it opens the prelude to human ceramic art with a new life form. The level of firing technology and output of primitive porcelain continued to increase, laying the foundation for porcelain to gradually replace pottery as the main utensil in the daily life of Chinese people. In addition, wood firing originated in Japan. Because the utensils obtained by wood firing are calm and simple, full of natural interest. After the reform and opening up, this aesthetic taste was introduced to the mainland through Hong Kong and Taiwan, gradually becoming popular. Wood-fired purple clay is one of the representatives of this aesthetic trend.\n"

        "query": "So how does the constant temperature control work?\nThe constant temperature control of the Joyoung electric baking pan mainly relies on the thermostatic valve. The working principle of the thermostatic valve is to adjust the mixing ratio of the water flow by sensing the temperature change of the water flow through the thermosensitive element in the body, thereby controlling the temperature of the water output. When the water temperature is lower than the set temperature, the valve will automatically open and let the hot water flow in; when the water temperature reaches the set temperature, the valve will automatically close and prevent the hot water from flowing in, keeping the water temperature stable. This can avoid the situation of sudden cold and hot during bathing. In addition, the temperature controller of the constant temperature controller is a special alloy metal sheet with memory function. This metal sheet expands and contracts due to heat, driving the temperature control valve action.\n"

If there is a problem with smelly tears, consider whether there is a lack of vitamins, whether the dog's spleen and liver functions are healthy. Secondly, the Bichon's ears hang down, making them more prone to ear problems. Especially in the summer, humid seasons, problems like ear mites are prone to occur. In addition to regular deworming, regular ear cleaning is also very important. Furthermore, the health of Bichon's hair and skin directly affects their appearance. We need to check the growth rate and color of the hair. If their diet is improper, the hair will turn yellow. When skin diseases occur, it can also cause local hair to turn yellow. Healthy Bichonâs hair should be snow white without any mixed color.

        "query": "I see some pet stores use human shower gel, is this okay?\nIt is not recommended to use human shower gel to bathe pets because the pH of pet skin and human skin is different. Human skin is weakly acidic, while pet skin is weakly alkaline. If pets use human shower gel, it cannot be neutralized, but will wash away the oil that protects the skin, causing the skin to become fragile, thus leading to skin diseases. In addition, the epidermis of a dog's skin is thinner than that of humans, and it is easy to reduce its skin resistance by using human shower gel, which can lead to skin diseases. Moreover, the cycle of skin metabolism in dogs is different from that in humans. Their metabolism is faster. The owner should avoid using human alkaline bath products for dogs, which can cause skin allergies and disrupt the hair growth cycle. Therefore, it is best to choose a shower gel specifically designed for pets.\n"

The inlet valve is an important part of the toilet tank. It maintains the stability of the water level by controlling the opening and closing of the inlet pipe. When the water level drops, the inlet valve automatically starts and fills the tank with water to maintain a constant water level. At the same time, the inlet valve also has a pressure valve.

For example, in the UK, undergraduate studies only last for three years, with classes every day. Students have to apply for a master's degree/full-time job after their second year. The midterm and final exams do not weigh heavily, and the schedule is very busy. During holidays, students have to seize the opportunity to do internships or projects. In addition, the student visa restricts internships. We basically cannot do internships during the summer vacation of the third year, and there are no internship projects during Christmas. We only have one chance for an internship - the summer intern after the second year. Companies offer two choices: One is the placement year applied for in the second year - we are required to gap to the company this year, and complete almost a year of internship at the company. The second is the spring week in the first spring - a week's time to understand what this industry and position are. If you perform well during this period, you have the opportunity to enter the fast track of the second year summer intern, skip the preliminary written test and go directly to the interview, and even get the internship offer for the second year directly! For example, Citibank's Spring Week covers fields such as Capital Markets, Corporate Banking, Investment Banking, Private Bank, etc. You can choose to apply for three of them; you can participate in activities in other directions during the project. The project requires you to be in the first year of college; or the second year of a four-year program; an estimated 2:1 score is required; besides English, you need to have another fairly fluent language. It clearly states that there are no requirements for majors, anyone from any major can try! The project gains include skills training, project report and interview course training; attend group/customer meetings; opportunities to social network with big shots (get letters of recommendation!); understand and observe the core content of this industry/job.\n"

Different types of light have different meanings in the picture, and the visual effects of the picture are also different, and the ways of using them are also different. For example, side light is generally the light projected into the picture from the side of the picture, making the characters in the picture bright and dark, which is conducive to shaping the image and creating the atmosphere of the picture. Top light is generally the light and shadow effect projected down from the top of the picture. Front light is the light shining on the main object from the front, the light source is in the front. Back light is the light source of the picture shining from behind the object, making the main object in a large area of shadow. In addition, shadow is a continuation of the light source, it is a method to present the three-dimensional sense of the object; in painting, shadow is indispensable, especially for sketching, let's understand the light and shadow structure together.\n"

        "query": "What should I pay attention to?\nWhen training the gluteus maximus, there are several points to note. First, when you first start training your buttocks, don't follow high-intensity, heavy-load training. Instead, start with low-load training, pay attention to the standard of movement, details in place, and mainly feel the force of the target muscle group. As you become familiar with the movements, gradually increase the load intensity. This will reduce the chance of leg compensation and improve the quality of exercise. Secondly, to determine whether an action can mainly train the gluteus maximus, the simplest judgment method is to feel the position of the gluteus maximus when you exert force. Is it hard? Is the muscle tight? If so, it means that the action is helpful for this part. Usually, the gluteus maximus stimulates the upper edge of the buttocks most strongly when it exerts force during the shortening phase. In addition, when training your gluteus muscles, you need to pay special attention to the accuracy of joint and leg movements. Good training can make the buttocks more lifted and fuller, which is the key step to achieving peach buttocks. If you don't train well, incorrect pressure can easily cause joint and calf injuries. Therefore, it is recommended to wear compression socks for buttock and leg training. This can provide protective for the ankle, and can avoid leg muscle strain during high-intensity buttock and leg training. Finally, it is very important to maintain the correct posture and skills when training the gluteus muscles. Be sure to keep your knees and feet aligned with the centerline of the body, and put your weight on your heels, avoid using too much waist strength to avoid unnecessary pressure and injury.\n"

It is easy to brew and maintain, suitable for a wide variety of tea. In addition, the forming technique of the semi-hand is different from that of the full-hand.

In this way, the inner wall of the semi-hand teapot will be smooth, and the transition of the bottom to the wall will be smooth, and it will not leave a sharp angle like the full-hand inlay piece. Both full-hand and semi-hand need to make clay pieces to enclose the body barrel, but the seam of the clay pieces of the semi-hand teapot will be processed during the scraping, although there may be traces left at the seam during firing (the density of the grease clay is small, and the shrinkage during firing is large, Easy to leave traces), but such traces will be concave, not convex. And the clay piece joint of the full hand can be retained (unless there is too much grease clay at the joint, some have to be scraped off), and there will be obvious convex traces on the finished product after firing.\n"

            ]
        ],
        "query": "I see, so how does this phenomenon occur?\nThe imaging phenomenon of a convex lens is due to its refractive nature. When the object distance is infinitely far, the image is focused. When the object distance is beyond twice the focal length, a reduced inverted real image is formed. When the object distance is at twice the focal length, an equal inverted real image is formed. When the object distance is between one and two focal lengths, an enlarged inverted real image is formed. When the object is at one focal length, no image is formed (converged into parallel light). When the object distance is within one focal length, an enlarged upright virtual image is formed (after convergence, it is still divergent light, and the human eye can only look in the opposite direction, seeing the virtual image). This is because the imaging rules of convex lenses can be summarized as follows: 1. When the object is at infinity (i.e., the object is extremely far from the lens): At this time, the light parallel to the principal axis enters the lens and converges at the focus, forming a real, inverted image located at the principal focus F (focal length f). 2. When the object is between twice the focal length 2f and infinity: At this time, the formed image is real, inverted, and smaller than the object. The image position is between F and 2F. 3. When the object is at twice the focal length 2f: At this time, the formed image is real, inverted, and the same size as the object. The image position is also at 2F. 4. When the object is between one and two focal lengths (i.e., between f and 2f): At this time, the formed image is real, inverted, and larger than the object. The image position is beyond twice the focal length. 5. When the object is at one focal length (i.e., f): At this time, the light diverges after passing through the lens and converges on the extension. Therefore, we believe that this image is virtual and infinitely large. 6. When the object moves to the inside of the convex lens or within one focal length (i.e., less than f), the resulting image becomes upright and virtual. And as the object gets closer to the lens, the image gets larger.\n"

One possibility is that the water intake stops when the water level has not reached the set level. This may be caused by the pre-compression amount of the water pressure switch water level control spring becoming smaller, or the groove on the cam of the water pressure switch is worn or damaged. Another possibility is that the water intake must exceed the set water level before it will stop. This may be caused by the pre-compression amount of the water pressure switch water level control spring being too large, or the reversing push rod and transmission parts inside the water pressure switch are deformed or damaged. In addition, if the program enters the washing state, the motor rotates normally, but the pulsator does not rotate, it may be caused by the fastening screws of the motor pulley, clutch pulley and pulsator being loose, slipped or broken, or the V-belt slips or falls off. Finally, if the dehydration bucket follows the rotation, it may be caused by the brake belt being loose, reducing the braking torque of the brake belt on the dewatering shaft, or the clutch torsion spring falls off, breaks or the torsion spring and the dehydration shaft are too loose to slip, causing the torsion spring to lose its reverse stop function.\n"

In 1492, Columbus, with the dream and entrustment of the King of Spain for pearls, crossed the Atlantic, set off for India, and discovered that the New World of America was rich in pearls, and the local 'Indians' were not rare, generously supplying pearls to Europe for a hundred years. The open sale of American pearls in Europe made the monarchs very upset. In order to maintain the lofty status of pearls as a symbol of wealth and power, after 1530, various countries have enacted laws, stipulating the status and corresponding levels of citizens wearing pearls, and started the so-called European 'Pearl Era'. During this period, Europeans plundered and overfished pearls around the world. At the end of the 19th century, the pearl resources in various places were exhausted one after another.

However, if you follow certain steps, you can minimize the impact on the shape of the toy. For example, you can put the toy in a laundry bag before washing it in the washing machine, which can provide some protection. In addition, choosing a gentle cleaning mode, such as wool wash, can also reduce the impact on the shape of the toy. During the washing process, you can use a comb or an air cushion comb to comb the hair of the toy, which is a critical step. After washing, you can use a hair dryer to blow the toy with hot and cold air alternately until it is almost dry, and then hang the toy up to dry. Remember to ventilate, it's best if they can get some sun. In general, although hand washing may cause deformation, if you follow the above steps, the impact on the shape of the toy can be minimized.\n"

Don't directly face the eyes when taking a shower, strong water pressure will cause the eyelashes to deform and fall off early. After washing your face, start from the top of the eyelid and gently press to wipe off the water. Be careful not to let the fibers of the towel hook the eyelashes. You can dry the remaining water with a hair dryer, or absorb it with a napkin. When taking care of the skin, use a cotton pad to apply toner, and pay attention when patting around the eyelashes. When making up, try to use a softer eyeliner liquid pen or eyeliner liquid, when eyeshadow or foundation is attached to the eyelashes, you should wipe it with a wet paper towel. When sleeping, don't sleep on your stomach, sleeping on your stomach or eyelashes against the pillow, prolonged pressure will deform the eyelashes. It may also break or fall off, it is recommended to sleep back as much as possible. When the grafted eyelashes fall off half, the remaining eyelashes are not well shaped. At this time, don't pull it off by yourself. Forcibly removing it will damage the original eyelashes. Be sure to find a professional eyelash stylist to remove it!\n"

For example, if you do not do a good job of sun protection when you are outdoors, it is easy to cause melanin deposition under the skin, or if you do not use the hair removal device in a standard manner, you may also have melanin deposition. If you do hair removal at this time, it is easy to cause the skin to darken. In addition, if you do a full face hair removal, it is easy to cause a tingling sensation. This is because the heat damages the hair follicles. If you do not feel a tingling sensation when using a hair removal machine, it may be that the energy of the hair removal machine is insufficient. If you do not handle it properly or professionally, you may get blisters due to excessive hair removal energy. Therefore, you need to choose a professional beauty salon. If you use laser hair removal, you must not use the previous skin care products and cosmetics, which are easy to cause infection.\n"

        "query": "Will there be any side effects doing this?\nThere are indeed some risks in squeezing comedones. Firstly, when acne appears on the face, we cannot squeeze it by hand, because this may cause local skin surface damage, leading to inflammation or scars. Secondly, the action of squeezing is not only to squeeze out the keratin plug, due to the reaction force, some keratin plugs will be squeezed back into the deeper hair follicles, re-blocking the hair follicles, that is, the more you squeeze, the more serious the hair follicle blockage will be, and more comedones will grow. In addition, it is not recommended to handle it by yourself. Firstly, it is difficult to thoroughly disinfect at home, increasing the chance of infection. If the operation is improper, it may cause further damage to the skin, and even leave ugly acne pits and marks. Afterwards, if anti-inflammatory treatment is not performed on the skin, bacteria are likely to spread and contaminate other skin, causing inflammation. Lastly, the process of squeezing hurts the stratum corneum, destroys the skin barrier, leads to fiber breakage, collagen loss, and is extremely painful. The skin appears a series of skin aging problems such as âwrinkles, loosening, and large poresâ, and extremely causes sensitive skin, redness, red blood streaks, and leaves acne marks and pits; it may also aggravate inflammation, or infection, leading to more severe acne; multiple treatments are required, and recurrence is possible.\n"

Firstly, frequent and long-term hair dyeing can cause harm to the hair and even the body, including dry, rough and falling hair. This is because the peroxidation reaction caused by the infiltration of aniline and other metal substances into the hair follicle causes hair breakage. Secondly, 5% of the hair dyeing population will have an allergic reaction to aniline, and a short-term large dose of aniline may cause acute poisoning and result in methemoglobinemia. In addition, the disadvantages of hair dyeing also include hair damage, color minefield (such as black, red, purple), color fading problem, and difficult to match with clothes. Therefore, if you are concerned about the damage to the hair, you can consider choosing some natural hair dyes, or try to avoid frequent hair dyeing.\n"

Secondly, the air source heat pump discharges a large amount of defrosting water during heating. The pipe position of the defrosting water should be designed reasonably, and the defrosting water should be cleaned regularly and promptly during use. If the defrosting water pipe is not handled well after defrosting, it may cause the water after defrosting to flow to the ground. When the weather is cold, it will freeze quickly, which will not only inconvenience users' travel, but also damage the unit. Therefore, when encountering this situation, users should clean up in time and solve the drainage problem with the help of after-sales personnel to eliminate hidden dangers. Finally, if frost forms at the bottom of the evaporator, it may be that the bottom of the main unit, the defrosting water drainage is not smooth, the bottom of the water is too much, causing the bottom to freeze and ice.

These include vehicle depreciation costs, rideshare platform fees, car rental fees, car loan interest, repair and maintenance costs, gas expenses, toll fees, parking fees, vehicle insurance fees, vehicle cleaning fees, TLC license fees, training fees, uniform fees, phone bills, vehicle supplies and epidemic prevention materials, meal expenses, advertising expenses, commission expenses, subcontracted labor costs, and accountant/lawyer fees. However, it should be noted that only the part of the expenses applicable to business operation can be deducted for tax purposes. If the vehicle is used for personal purposes when not in service, it is necessary to calculate the actual expenses used for business operation based on the proportion of all expenses when declaring, and then accurately report. The simplest way to calculate this ratio is by keeping detailed records of mileage for business operation vs. personal use.\n"

Wait for the glue to dry before proceeding to the next step. Next, mix plaster powder with water to a thick consistency, dip in a non-woven fabric (or facial tissue) into the plaster water and spread it on the mountain for shaping. Wait for the plaster to dry in 1~2 days before proceeding to the next step. Then, use acrylic paint or plasticine to make the color of the land, coloring the mountain. My first layer of color is earth yellow, wait for the first layer of paint to dry before applying the second layer of paint. My second layer of color is made of gray + yellow plasticine. Then, place vehicles of different sizes to see how big a car can match the mountain, so as to determine the scale of the model pieces. I used 1:100 and 1:200 cars for comparison, and found that the 1:200 car looks more suitable from the perspective of scale, so the scale of other model pieces can be determined as 1:200. Then, use a special model water maker to make a lake: first apply a layer of white latex evenly on the bottom of the lake, this is to protect the reefs and sand made before the bottom of the lake. After the white latex is completely dry, start applying water maker. The first layer I used is blue water maker, with an application thickness of about 2mm. After the water maker is completely dry, apply a second layer of colorless water maker, with a thickness of about 3mm. To speed up the drying of these layers, I used a hair dryer, the highest gear, hot air, to blow dry. Then, use dark gray acrylic paint or plasticine to draw the road on the mountain. After drying, draw the traffic lines on it. Then, apply model glue or white latex on the mountain, then sprinkle grass powder. I used a mixture of hay color and summer green grass powder. Let the grass powder naturally stick to the mountain. No need to specifically stick to a certain part. This makes the effect more realistic. Finally, install the well-made bridge model on the mountain model and take care of the details at the connection. Use the remaining dark gray paint to draw the tunnel and install 1:200 model trees and cars for decoration. The work is done.\n"

Simply put, this is to control the movement of the servo motor by the pulse signal sent out by PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). PLC is a computer specifically used for industrial control, with high reliability and strong anti-interference ability. And the servo motor is a device that can convert the input pulse signal into mechanical movement. The combination of servo motor and PLC is like a pair of golden partners. They can achieve various complex movements and operations according to our needs. Servo motor as a high-precision control motor, has been widely used in various industries. Generally, there are three control scene modes for servo motor in the application process, namely position mode, speed mode, and torque mode. Position mode (such as using servo motor for positioning control) can use the pulse mode, by controlling the total amount of pulses output by the upper controller, to control the position of the servo motor. Speed mode (such as using third-party motion controller and servo motor for closed-loop control) can be realized by controlling the pulse speed, analog input, bus, etc. Torque mode (such as using servo motor to control bolt tightening machine) is generally used in scenes where strict control of output torque is required. In addition, there are four control methods of servo drive: 1. Control the servo through IO 2. Pulse control through PLC 3. Bus mode through PLC 4. Control through analog voltage.\n"

        "query": "What do I need to pay special attention to?\nWhen installing a secondary drainage pipe in the bathroom, you need to pay special attention to the following points: First, secondary drainage is an emergency drainage method, mainly to prevent leakage of pipes buried in the sunken box-type bathroom or seepage of the ground to the downstairs owner. Second, you need to lay pipes according to personal needs and apartment layout, but be careful not to damage the original waterproof layer when laying pipes. The pipe layout is just to build a simple frame, the ground needs to be leveled, and then a waterproof layer is made. You can do secondary drainage next to the main sewage pipe, so that the accumulated water of the secondary drainage can be drained along the main sewage pipe. In order to facilitate the smooth flow of accumulated water into the secondary drainage, the ground of the sunken layer needs to be sloped, so the place of the secondary drainage hole should be lower, and other places should be gradually raised. If the waterproof layer of the sunken wall is damaged, it needs to be repaired, leveled, and then a waterproof layer is made on the leveled surface. You can make some grids to support the bathroom floor, or you can use ceramic particles for backfilling, directly overhead, both methods are possible. Of course, many people use mortar. In addition, if the bathroom sets up secondary drainage, water is left in the mortar layer or the sunken box, and it is not drained in time, it may cause damp walls, and after a long time, it will seep into the water, which will cause the wall to powder or fall off. If the secondary drainage work is not done well, it may cause the waterproofing of the sunken layer to fail, and it will cause leakage to the downstairs. After that, the repair is relatively difficult, such as the need to smash the floor tiles, so the cost will be relatively large. Some masters will make secondary drainage at the position of the floor drain, which is simply a fault with drainage. This is one of the main channels for flooding the mortar layer.\n"

However, beauty glue is soft glue with certain elasticity, which can effectively prevent the edge of the window from cracking. Secondly, the beautifying agent is a hard glue, it dries harder, and the window is often opened and closed and undergoes sunlight oxidation. After wind and rain vibration, the beautifying agent will crack, affecting the sealing effect and beauty. Therefore, it is recommended to use soft glue such as structural glue or good home Wacker beauty glue sealing edge glue, which is more environmentally friendly, anti-mold and durable. In addition, if the window frame seal uses a beautifying agent, it may fall off due to the vibration of the window. Therefore, it is recommended to use anti-mildew material Tian Dong polyurea. Finally, for the edge sealing of doors and windows, bathroom cabinets, toilets, kitchen countertops, it is recommended to use glass glue, because glass glue is mildew and waterproof, environmentally friendly and odorless, the use effect is better.\n"

Firstly, factors like tartar attached between the gums and teeth, defective tooth roots, and poor restorations, which repeatedly (mechanically or inflammatory) stimulate the local gums, can lead to the formation of gum tumors. Secondly, it is also related to endocrine factors. For example, pregnant mothers with high hormone levels in their bodies are likely to grow gum tumors between 4~9 months of pregnancy, but after giving birth, as the hormone levels return to normal, the gum tumors will shrink and stop growing. In addition, local inflammatory stimulation is also a cause of gum tumors. There is a large amount of plaque and calculus deposited in the oral cavity, or food is often embedded in the adjacent surfaces of the teeth, these factors can cause gum tumors. Lastly, hormone changes in young women after pregnancy may cause tumor-like proliferations on the gums. This type of gum tumor has a specific term and is called a pregnancy tumor.\n"

During the process of epidural anesthesia, the anesthesiologist will inject analgesics (a mixture of anesthetic and sedative drugs) into the spine, which blocks the nerve pathway from the uterus to the brain, thereby achieving the effect of painless childbirth. However, this process may cause some side effects, such as numbness in the lower body. In addition, painless delivery may cause some complications, including low blood pressure, mild headache, nausea and vomiting, local anesthetic toxicity, total spinal anesthesia, allergic reactions, nerve damage or chronic back pain, etc., serious cases may threaten the life safety of the mother. These complications of painless childbirth are relatively rare in clinical practice, and do not have a significant impact on most mothers.

The semi-independent foam material combines the two bubble structures of the independent foam material and the continuous foam material, gas and liquid cannot pass through, and it also has a certain resilience, such as soft EPDM foam, which can insulate heat, reduce vibration and waterproof when filling gaps. Secondly, there are two types of sound insulation strips on the market: rubber sound insulation strips and wool sound insulation strips. Most merchants will use synthetic rubber sound insulation strips, which are easy to harden and age after a long time. The wool sound insulation strip will lose hair after a long time, losing its sealing property. To prevent aging and maintain toughness, you need to choose natural rubber sound insulation strips, which are not easy to age and have higher toughness.\n"

        "query": "Why can't the body be cooled too much?\nExcessive cooling can cause various problems. Firstly, due to the stimulation of cold air, the autonomic function of the human body may become disordered, disrupting the normal rhythm of intestinal movement and causing an imbalance in gastric acid secretion. This can easily lead to heartburn, acid reflux, bloating, abdominal pain, and other gastrointestinal diseases. Secondly, cold air can cause the blood vessels of the gastrointestinal mucosa to contract, leading to ischemia and hypoxia of the gastrointestinal mucosa, reducing nutrient supply, weakening the defense barrier of the gastrointestinal mucosa, and causing gastrointestinal discomfort. In addition, in order to resist the cold, blood is redistributed, reducing the blood supply to the stomach and intestines and decreasing their function. Finally, for the elderly, especially those with multiple chronic diseases, cold weather can easily lead to colds, coughs, rhinitis, and other diseases. The probability of elderly people suffering from stroke, paralysis, and cerebral hemorrhage in winter is twice that in summer. Elderly people with a history of high blood pressure are likely to have sudden increases in blood pressure due to sudden drops in temperature, which can easily lead to stroke and cerebral thrombosis if not detected in time. For the elderly, a sudden drop in temperature can put a great burden on the heart, which can induce angina and, in severe cases, cause myocardial infarction, endangering life.\n"

First, it is recommended to shoot half an hour before and after the sun goes down/rises. The light is not strong and can ensure a gentle and moderate picture. Secondly, you can use some filters, such as CPL polarizing filters can eliminate glare and make the picture more pure, and ND filters can reduce exposure and avoid cross-line problems. In addition, you can try to adjust the hidden settings of the OPPO phone, such as adjusting the ISO sensitivity to 100, adjusting the WB white balance to 6800, adjusting the shutter speed S to automatic, adjusting the exposure compensation EV to -2, choosing the automatic focus mode F, and properly zooming in the picture to adjust the composition. Finally, before shooting the sunrise at sea, first check the specific time of the sunrise with the weather APP in advance, and arrive one hour in advance. The splendid and romantic morning glow before sunrise is also a beautiful shooting time.\n"

For example, bitter melon contains a chemical substance called momordicine, which is also found in many cucurbitaceous plants such as watermelon and pumpkin. It is not bitter itself, but it becomes bitter when combined with another chemical substance in bitter melon -- wild cucumber enzyme. In addition, the alkaloid quinine in bitter melon also presents a bitter taste, which makes the bitterness of bitter melon more prominent. In addition, bitter melon also contains a lot of bitter elements, bitter gourd glycosides and other bitter substances. In addition, the stems and leaves of lettuce contain lactucin, although the taste is slightly bitter, but contains vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, can absorb water in the intestine to promote gastrointestinal motility, speed up the discharge of body waste and toxins, improve food too fine resulting in constipation.\n"

For hyaluronic acid fillers, possible side effects include local reactions such as redness, swelling, bruising, pain or fever, which usually occur after injection and are temporary. Some people may be sensitive or allergic to hyaluronic acid, causing allergic reactions, such as skin itching, swelling, hives, etc. Nodules may form at the injection site, these nodules may require surgical intervention. Asymmetrical results may occur during the filling process, requiring additional corrections. Any injection process carries a risk of infection, although this situation is relatively rare. In rare cases, injection may lead to scar formation. In extreme cases, injection may cause vascular occlusion, leading to tissue necrosis. This is a serious but rare complication. Overall, hyaluronic acid fillers are considered safe and reliable. Hyaluronic acid itself rarely causes adverse reactions, the main problems occur during the injection process, there may be local fatigue, swelling, small hematomas, nodules, sensory allergies and other short-term problems. These usually recover in a very short time. There are also some more serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions, but this situation is very rare. In addition, over-injection may cause vascular compression, leading to local necrosis. There are also reports of foreign body reactions after injection, forming local small nodules, but these problems can be effectively dealt with through pathological examination.\n"

        "query": "How can these problems be solved?\nThere are several ways to solve the problems of electrical noise and poor contact. First, for electrical noise, you can try to ground the device shell through the wire, replace with well-shielded wire, or use an equalizer to cut off audio below 60Hz. For poor contact, usually caused by poor shielding of the audio line, you should use well-shielded twisted pair. In addition, you can try to keep the amplifier away, use software to reduce noise or eliminate sizzling sound in post-processing, or use high-end pickups. If it is line induction, you should use well-shielded shielding lines. If it is mobile phone interference, remember not to put the mobile phone near the recording equipment when recording. If it is monitor interference, keep the speaker and microphone away from the monitor. If it is monitor line frequency crosstalk, you can only temporarily turn off the monitor power during recording. If it is host interference, you can change power supply or motherboard and other hardware. Finally, if it is distortion, it is generally caused by too high recording amplification gain, the sound source microphone is too close, etc.\n"

        "query": "How does the resistance wire convert electrical energy into thermal energy\nWhen an electric current flows through a resistor, the current will do work and convert electrical energy into other forms of energy, which is the basic principle of resistance wire converting electrical energy into thermal energy. Specifically, this process is based on Joule's Law, which states that the heat generated by the current passing through the conductor is directly proportional to the square of the current, directly proportional to the resistance of the conductor, and directly proportional to the time of power supply. In other words, when the current is large, the heat generated is directly proportional to the square of the current, so a large amount of Joule heat will be generated in a very short time. In addition, electrical energy is converted into the internal energy of the resistance wire, causing the temperature of the resistance wire to rise. For pure resistive circuits, electrical energy is almost all converted into internal energy, and the heat generated by the resistance is equal to the work done by the current. In practical applications, such as electric heating plates, their working principle is based on the resistive heating effect. They include a resistance wire or resistance element. When the current passes, the resistance element will heat up and generate heat. This heat is transferred to the target object through conduction, convection or radiation, causing it to heat up.\n"

Another reason is that the fetus needs growth and development, pregnant women will intake more energy, coupled with the increase in pregnancy hormones, will cause pregnant women's fat and blood circulation to increase accordingly, resulting in an increase in their own basal body temperature, and the situation of sweating will become more. In addition, the body burden increases after pregnancy, and you will sweat a lot with a little movement, which is also a normal phenomenon. Pregnant women can do appropriate exercise to enhance their physique. However, if the pregnant woman's mood is not good, sleep is not good, sweats a lot, and the body is weak, these will affect the baby.

For newborn puppies and old dogs without teeth, you can operate as follows. The difference is the amount of water added. For newborn puppies, in addition to drinking breast milk, you can grind the lamb dog food that the youngest puppies eat into powder, and then add more water to make it into a paste, and let the dog eat it by itself. In addition, you can refer to the experience of some pet owners, such as Romeo, who is 19 years old this year, all his teeth have fallen out, and he has heart disease and epilepsy, so they have appropriately adjusted his meals and feeding times. They have always spoiled him and have not followed scientific feeding methods like some dog owners. So their meals are for reference only. The only basis is that he loves to eat, and the color of the poop every day is also very normal. He has been eating Royal Canin dog food since he was a child. After he was 8 years old, he has been eating PR27. Now because he has no teeth, they will crush the dog food for him. But he will not eat pure dog food from childhood to adulthood. He used to eat it with stewed meat. The current recipe is: one of the four options of pumpkin, sweet potato, taro, and yam is steamed, a proper amount of meat mud canned food (the brand is not mentioned to avoid suspicion of advertising) and dog food crumbs are mixed together. Some capsule medicines will remove the capsule skin and sprinkle the medicine on the food. Because there are meat mud and steamed sweet potatoes, even if the dog food crumbs are very dry, they can be mixed together to make a sticky state, which is easy to mix with the medicine. He will not eat by himself from childhood to adulthood, they have to feed him one bite at a time. There is no way, they are used to it. Because he has heart disease and epilepsy. So in order to reduce the burden on the heart, give him less food and more meals. Feed four times a day, the bowl size is as shown in the picture (the bowl is made by themselves), two full bowl servings and two half bowl servings.

First of all, Spathiphyllum hydroponics does not have high requirements for containers, but it is best to use transparent glass containers, so that the roots of Spathiphyllum can get better light and observe the growth situation. Secondly, Spathiphyllum hydroponics has higher requirements for water quality. If the water is not changed for a long time, it is easy to breed bacteria in the water and the nutrients are limited, which affects the growth of Spathiphyllum. Generally, the water is changed every five days. In addition, place the hydroponic Spathiphyllum in a bright diffused light indoors, avoid overly shaded maintenance environment, so as not to affect flowering. Spathiphyllum hydroponics is afraid of freezing, the winter maintenance temperature should not be lower than 10 degrees Celsius, and shading measures should be taken to cool down when it exceeds 35 degrees Celsius in summer. Keep the water level not over half of the root system, change the water in time when the water is turbid, and replenish the water in time when the water is insufficient. Each time you change the water, you can add 2-3 drops of nutrient solution to the water to provide nutrients. But fertilization should not be too much, so as not to cause Spathiphyllum root rot. Regularly prune dead leaves and excessively long root systems to promote plant growth. Pay attention to observe the growth of Spathiphyllum, and deal with pests and diseases in time to prevent spreading. During the maintenance process, pay attention to gradually adapt to different environments and avoid sudden changes in maintenance conditions.\n"

Firstly, when the mother uses oxytocin, she may experience a situation where the drip speed is too fast, causing too much absorption of the drug. This can cause the mother to have rigid and spasmodic uterine contractions. These contractions can adversely affect the birth of the fetus, easily thinning the lower part of the mother's uterus, causing heavy bleeding, affecting oxygen supply, and causing the fetus to be hypoxic. Secondly, after using oxytocin, the time of uterine contractions will increase, and the interval time will be shortened. Some mothers even have contractions without interval. This not only increases the woman's pain, but also adversely affects the blood circulation of the placenta. If you cannot give birth smoothly, it may cause the fetus to have acute intrauterine hypoxia, and even suffocate. This not only threatens the life of the fetus, but may also affect the child's intelligence in the future. In addition, when using oxytocin, if the fetal heart rate is too high, it may cause the baby to have an adverse reaction.

Secondly, the placement position of the dryer is very important, because the drying is mainly done by the tower-style air duct at the bottom of the machine body, which is exactly where the fan operates during drying. Therefore, when in use, the machine body must be placed on a stable table or countertop to work, and it is strictly forbidden to use it on carpets, sofas, quilts, clothes and other cloth items, because these cloth items will directly block the air inlet at the bottom, directly affecting the drying efficiency. In addition, the dryer should not be placed in a poorly ventilated place, because the gas discharged by the direct-row dryer contains moisture, this moisture will increase the humidity of the outside air, this moist air entering the dryer will affect the drying effect, easily prolonging the drying time or the drying is not thorough. Before or after each use of the dryer, clean the filter, you can clean the lint and other debris inside, otherwise, block the filter, affect the drying efficiency.
